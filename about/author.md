## About Me

My name is Derik DeLong and I&#8217;m a 29 year old senior software engineer. I&#8217;m currently employed writing code in Woburn.

I graduated from the [University of Massachusetts at Amherst](http://www.umass.edu) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I spent an abnormally short four years there.

I leave droppings all over the web and my [about.me page](http://about.me/derik) has a decent list of the more popular places that I leave them.

I grew up in Northborough, Massachusetts and currently reside in Tewksbury, Massachusetts.
