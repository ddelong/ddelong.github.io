This is standard update fare. Fire up software update or download the updates from Apple ([1.3.1](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/safariupdate131.html) and [2.0.1](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/safariupdate201.html)).

Apple's documentation is pretty light on what's changed.

> Safari version _2.0.1/1.3.1_ for Mac OS X _Tiger/Panther_ improves website compatibility, application stability and support for 3rd party web applications.

It sounds like WebKit might have been updated (perhaps to include Acid test compatibility). It could also be that minor parts of the interface were amended, but I didn't find any such changes. If you use Saft, you're going to have to update that too.
