I visited Amherst to spend some time with Scott and to see bob&#8217;s new apartment. Friday night&#8217;s plan was to do a little drinking in the dorms and reminisce. Well, one beer begot two, two begot three, and so on until I finally finished all twelve beers I had. I was feeling great at that point, but that didn&#8217;t last.

I woke up in the middle of the night feeling sick, but I was barely awake and still quite intoxicated. Because of my recent troubles with my blog here and the fact that my host suggested it was the PHP code, I was having a dream about dealing with some troublesome PHP code.

I had no idea I was no longer in the dream, so when I crawled to the end of Scott&#8217;s bed and things came back up, I thought it was because of the PHP code. I woke Scott up and he asked if I was all right. I naturally said &#8220;PHP code shouldn&#8217;t make me puke. I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221; This confused Scott to no end (and rightly so).

I&#8217;ve learned my lesson. Alcohol and programming languages don&#8217;t mix.
