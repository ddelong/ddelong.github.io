My coworkers haven&#8217;t seen me without my [Morf stress ball](http://www.handstands.com/retail/fun_fitness/morf.shtml) since I got it at Staples. I constantly have to do something with my hands and it occupied them. _squish squish_

I was sitting at my desk, listening to a podcast, and looking at my computer screen. All of a sudden, I heard a squirting sound and something touching my shoulder. I froze. What was that? I looked over at my shoulder and all over my shirt was a bunch of yellow goo. A tiny hole opened itself as I squeezed and the contents were now decorating my shirt.

Fabulous. The stress ball couldn&#8217;t take the stress. My attempts to rinse the goo off were unsuccessful. Of course that put me in a terribly pissy mood. However, according to [their site](http://www.handstands.com/retail/fun_fitness/morf_faq.html), the goo will wash out.

> If a MORF ball leaks its gravy-like contents onto clothing rest assured that since the coloring comes from food-grade dye, it will wash out completely in one or two trips to the washing machine. Use a spot remover like &#8220;Spray n Wash&#8221; if the area has dried or hardened. Try to wash it out as soon as possible. Red-colored gravy make take multiple wash cycles.

**Update:** You&#8217;ll be glad to know it washed out (warning: it was the yellow and not the red as Andy pointed out). I also will _not_ be buying another.
