Apple has released a security update for both Panther and Jaguar. You can get it at [the download section of their site](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/) or by using Software Update. It weighed in at 12.7 MB coming in through mine.

As always, Maccentral has [an excellent writeup](http://www.macworld.com/news/2004/12/02/securityupdate/index.php).
