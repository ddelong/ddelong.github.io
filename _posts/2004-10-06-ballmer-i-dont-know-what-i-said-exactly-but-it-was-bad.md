Following a lambasting on the web normally reserved for politicians, Steve Ballmer has [conveniently forgotten what he said](http://hardware.silicon.com/storage/0,39024649,39124702,00.htm). Nevermind the fact that his comments are recorded in nearly every iPod, Mac, and computer based new source, or the fact that they are also in perhaps hundreds of blogs, he just can't remember what exactly was said.

This says two things:

  * He knows he was wrong.
  * He doesn't have the balls to stand up and admit that he said it.

&#8220;I don't recall&#8221; doesn't hold up in court and it certainly doesn't hold up in the media. Microsoft's public relations people should tackle and wrestle him to the ground before he makes another colossal blunder.
