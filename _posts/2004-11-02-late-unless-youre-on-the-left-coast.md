Just like everyone else, I&#8217;m going to encourage everyone to go vote. It&#8217;s too late for all of you in MA (not that it matters anyway).

I hope you all made your presence felt in the polls. I personally made mine felt by writing in [Scott Daugherty](/scott) for all unopposed candidates. Good times.
