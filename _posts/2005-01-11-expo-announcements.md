New from the expo:

  * [The Mac mini](http://www.apple.com/macmini/)
  * [The iPod shuffle](http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/)
  * [iWork](http://www.apple.com/iwork/)
  * [iLife '05](http://www.apple.com/ilife/)

The other announcements aren't terribly exciting and the lack of a Tiger release date was disappointing. More tonight.
