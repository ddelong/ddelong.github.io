Maybe it was an April Fool's joke on Think Secret's part. Maybe they were trying to set up a legal defense that they guess a lot (and are wrong). Maybe a delay was introduced. Who knows? At any rate, there was no Tiger announcement which would have made all the wakka-wakka gags _almost_ bareable. Now my problem is that without Tiger as a new toy coming soon, I'm starting to eye a new SATA boot drive (a 300 GB drive). Keep me from spending money Apple!
