[Verizon FiOS](http://verizonfios.com/) is looking real good, $44.95 for 15 Mbps down/2 Mbps up. My Comcast cable access is 8 Mbps for $52.95. Verizon sends me advertisements in the mail multiple times per week advertising their fiber internet service.

Given, it's lumped in with those mass mailers that clog my mailbox, but it's getting sent directly to my house. They proclaim in big proud letters:

> The limitless fiber-optic power of Verizon FiOS Internet is now here.

Am I interested? You bet. Inevitably, their address checker proclaims me ineligible. After getting the 20th advertisement, I decided I wanted to find out why Verizon was taunting me. I got back this response:

> Thank you for contacting the Verizon eCenter. My name is [deleted], and I will be handling your request today.
> 
> This message is in response to your email dated September 20, 2006. You inquired about receiving advertisements for FiOS through the mail. I understand your concern and I will be happy to assist you. 
> 
> I apologize for any misunderstanding. Unfortunately, we do not have the capability of pre-qualifying all of our customers lines for FiOS service before sending out the advertisements for our products and services. Our advertisements include the disclaimer that states that Verizon FiOS/DSL Internet Service is provided by Verizon Online and is not available in all areas. Service availability is subject to final confirmation by Verizon. 
> 
> At this time we do not have a date when FiOS will be available.
> 
> Verizon continues to work to provide FiOS access to as many customers as possible. So, while you may not qualify for high-speed Internet access from Verizon today, it is possible that you could be able to receive it in the future as the technologies improve.
> 
> If you haven't already done so, you may check the availability of Verizon Fios any time you wish at:
> 
>              http://www.verizon.net/fios
>     
> 
> Simply enter your telephone number in the space provided. If FiOS is not available, you will have the option of requesting an email notification when it is available.
> 
> It has been my goal today to address and clarify your concerns related to Fios service availability. I hope I have succeeded in meeting that goal. In the meantime, if you have any other questions, please let us know. We look forward to serving you.
> 
> Thank you for using Verizon. We appreciate your business.

Pleasant enough, so I can't fault them for that. However, the line &#8220;Unfortunately, we do not have the capability of pre-qualifying all of our customers lines for FiOS service before sending out the advertisements for our products and services.&#8221; is bunk. They can automatically supply that information using the database linked to their website.

Naturally, perhaps the advertising company they've hired just blankets areas, but that's a problem they are completely in control of. They could market more accurately.

Could I just ignore it? Sure, but the fact is that very rarely am I interested in things I get in the mail. The one time I'm interested in buying the product I get jerked around. Bah.
