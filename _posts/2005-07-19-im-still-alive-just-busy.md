I realized today that between a real lack of Apple/Mac news and having lots to do (relating to the mysterious piece of news I referred to in our last exciting episode) that I likely wouldn&#8217;t be posting much, though the [supplemental](http://del.icio.us/d00d/supplement) is going to get regular updates.

The good news is that once I get back into the groove, I&#8217;ll be adding a lot of content that is in a vein that this site hasn&#8217;t explored before. Stay tuned.
