I know you&#8217;re all very excited boys and girls. Apple has bumped their iBook computers.

We now have: \* A 1.2GHz 12&#8243; iBook with 30GB hard drive and a combo drive \* A 1.33GHz 14&#8243; iBook with 60GB hard drive and your choice of combo or super drive

All three models sport: \* 512KB of Level 2 Cache \* 133MHz system bus \* 256MB of PC2100 RAM built-in (with a single slot free, allowing for 1.25GB total) \* ATI Mobility Radeon 9200 with 32MB of SDRAM \* One Firewire 400 port \* Two USB 2.0 ports \* Video mirroring (no spanning) \* V.92 56Kbps modem \* 10/100Base-T Ethernet port \* **Airport Extreme on all models** * _Optional_ Bluetooth * Display supporting 1024&#215;768 resolution

More details are available [at Apple](http://www.apple.com/ibook/specs.html).

Pricing is $999 for the 12&#8243;, and $1,299 and $1,499 for the 14&#8243; version with combo drive and superdrive respectively.

The 12&#8243; isn&#8217;t a bad deal, but for the prices of the 14&#8243; iBooks, I&#8217;d move on up to the 12&#8243; Powerbook. The screen may be bigger on the 14&#8243;, but again, the actual pixel space is the same, so things will only be bigger on the 14&#8243; screen. It&#8217;s good to see Airport Extreme on all laptops that Apple now offers (though this should have happened earlier). The small amount of RAM is disappointing again.

I&#8217;m going to predict that one of the first things that nay-sayers will harp on is the lack of Firewire 800. Get over it, this is a consumer machine and it&#8217;s entirely inappropriate to have.
