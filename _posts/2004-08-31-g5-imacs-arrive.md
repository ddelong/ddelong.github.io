After a long iMac-less summer, [Apple](http://www.apple.com) has announced the [new iMacs](http://www.apple.com/imac/) with full specs and pictures.

I&#8217;d list them here, but I figure there&#8217;s not much point. You can all read. Of note is the fact that the iMacs are using a system bus that is a third of the processor speed. This is a first for G5&#8217;s, but probably won&#8217;t have a large effect upon performance. They&#8217;ve also adopted a new form factor that has essentially moved the entire guts of the machine into the LCD frame. This begs the question, why couldn&#8217;t they make a G5 Powerbook again? I won&#8217;t go off on a rant about misplaced priorities at Apple again. I&#8217;m sure that can come back another day.

Gone is the 15&#8243; iMac. 17&#8243; and 20&#8243; are the only two sizes. They are widescreen, keeping with Apple style, but to contain all the computer parts, there is a rather large white (unsightly) border below the screen. I&#8217;m not saying I don&#8217;t like the new iMac. It seems like a very nice computer. It didn&#8217;t wow me like the original flat panel iMac did though. The iMac G4 made me question whether I wanted a Powermac. That&#8217;s not the case this time around.

I do see this as a great machine for many consumer users. The iMac is back to being a really tight integrated machine again. While the swivel arm was great and functional, it did make the iMac a little less all-in-one like. I&#8217;d also like to note how it resembles the 20th Anniversary Mac. I can think of one person this computer is perfect for already, mother dearest. She spends most of her time at home in the kitchen. It&#8217;s hard enough getting her to touch a computer, nevermind dragging her upstairs into my father&#8217;s study to sit her down at his old frankenstein of a Mac. Putting this on the kitchen counter would give her instantaneous access to a new world of things.

At any rate, check it out. It may have been what you were waiting for.
