I came across [this article](http://www.geektronica.com/2005-10-04-netflix-analysis-spreadsheet) recently, which includes an Excel spreadsheet for analyzing your own Netflix usage.

The problem is that Excel v.X for Mac likes to paste tab delimited data into multiple columns (as it well should). The original sheet was written to parse the data out of a single column based upon character position. That's clever if you don't have it separated. It's a lot more work though.

I made my own clone for Mac users. There are far fewer instructions built into the sheet though because I'm lazy. The first three values in the analysis section can be set as seen fit. To input your data, select the cell just below &#8220;Shipped&#8221; and paste after copying out of the email you get from Netflix when you request the full history. Make sure that the fourth column is filled in with the formula as far down as your data goes.

[Download the sheet](http://downloads.godlikenerd.com/netflixanalysis.zip) and try it out.
