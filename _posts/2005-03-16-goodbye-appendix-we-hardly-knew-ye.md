Well, it was confirmed. I had appendicitis and they removed my appendix. I&#8217;m appendix-less. Is that a turn-on or -off for women? <!--more-->

### Two Hamburgers Please

The whole ordeal started on Sunday night after having two hamburgers. My stomach felt really tight. It wasn&#8217;t normal, but I chocked it up to eating too much too fast. I tried to relieve myself, but no dice. The pain only moved down to my lower right. I immediately started thinking appendicitis.

### Dude Man

There&#8217;s a reason I jumped so quickly to that conclusion. I can safely blame Scott for that. He had to regale me with the story of his mother having a burst appendix. Naturally, that&#8217;s dangerous and it&#8217;s possible die from it. However, when I hear or even think of the word &#8220;appendix&#8221;, all I can hear in my head is Scott.

> Dude, man. She could have died man.

He told me this at some point when I was especially impressionable apparently. Every time I had gas, I&#8217;d press on my lower abdomen to make sure. I sure as hell wasn&#8217;t waiting for it to burst.

That&#8217;s why I waited instead of acting immediately. I went to bed in the hopes that it would go away. I slept through the night which I took as a good sign.

### You&#8217;re Still Here?

Well, the pain was still there in the morning. I started dressing really casually for work. I wasn&#8217;t feeling good still but I figured I could work through it. It would subside just like all the gas I mistakenly thought was appendicitis. I started making oatmeal. All of a sudden, I felt woozy. Maybe it was time to call the doctor.

Naturally, at 6:30 in the morning, the doctor&#8217;s office wasn&#8217;t open. I got the answering service which paged the on-call doctor. I got a very sleepy doctor to tell me there wasn&#8217;t anything she could do and if I was concerned, go to the emergency room.

I took that advice and woke my brother. Thankfully he was home for Spring Break. My father was busy taking my mother to the hospital for surgery. It&#8217;s a strange coincidence I&#8217;ll admit. It&#8217;s a good thing he was there because I had no idea how to get to Marlborough Hospital. I&#8217;ll give him props for waking up on short sleep to do that.

### Berry Smoothies

I got myself checked in and my father had arrived by the time they actually called me in to see the doctor. The doctor thought it was appendicitis. She called for a surgeon and a [CAT scan](http://science.howstuffworks.com/cat-scan.htm). For the next hour and a half, I drank the worst berry (but probably most expensive) smoothie I&#8217;d ever had. It was oral contrast solution. I was prepped and sent to the CAT scan room.

As I laid on the pad, the technician attached the IV contrast to me and warned me of its side-effects. She told me that I would feel really warm, might taste something in the back of my throat, and feel like I was pissing myself. Thankfully, only two of those came true (the former two). The warmth was disconcerting I&#8217;ll admit.

### Ready, Setty, Zzzzz

With that, I met my surgeon and it was up to the operating room I was to go. I was naturally apprehensive as it was my first time in surgery. Shocking I know, but as I tell everyone around me, I don&#8217;t get sick. I got odd looks from the doctors when I told them of no recurring conditions, no medication, no recent sickness, and no surgery in the past. I&#8217;ve never even had oral surgery.

I&#8217;ve never been put under either. After rushing me up to the OR, I was given a slight sedative. I started feeling sleepy. Next, I was brought into the actual room. It was an amazing flurry activity as I remember it, but at the time, I wasn&#8217;t very agitated by it, likely because of the sedative. I remember getting tickled on my lower abdomen as I was shaved down there. At that point, an oxygen mask was over my face so I was feeling really out of it. Then I was told the knockout drug entered the IV tube.

At the time, I thought _Uh oh, I&#8217;m still awake. This isn&#8217;t good._

### Wakey Wakey

I suddenly woke up in the reception area outside the actual operating room. It was all over. Everything went fine. That was a relief. I was still groggy. I was aware enough to notice the cute student nurse. Sadly, she did little more than help move me to my recovery room.

Once there, I started coming out of my daze. My nurse for the evening (who was also incredibly cute and I would have liked to taken to dinner) introduced herself. She gave me some demerol in a shot. That was a very bad thing. It&#8217;s meant to relieve pain, but it made my shoulder (where it was injected) incredibly sore. In fact, the pain I felt from that far exceeded the actual pain I felt from my three incisions. It also knocked me out. The rest of my afternoon disappeared.

### Lots of TV

The rest of my stay was fairly uneventful. I watched lots of TV. I got up and walked around with the nurse. I slept. The next day I started eating regular food again. My doctor cleared me to leave the hospital. That was basically the entire event.
