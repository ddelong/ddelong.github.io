From my webhost:

> Â It is an error that we are working on and fixing. But the current fix out be to restart apache. This error is rare and shouldn't rear it's head again. Thanks for patience.
There you have it. If you are having trouble with WordPress sending back zero-sized replies/no data/connection reset by peer, then you may need to restart Apache. I'll write more when I find out more.
