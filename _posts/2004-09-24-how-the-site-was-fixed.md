From my webhost:

> Â It is an error that we are working on and fixing. But the current fix out be to restart apache. This error is rare and shouldn&#8217;t rear it&#8217;s head again. Thanks for patience.
There you have it. If you are having trouble with WordPress sending back zero-sized replies/no data/connection reset by peer, then you may need to restart Apache. I&#8217;ll write more when I find out more.
