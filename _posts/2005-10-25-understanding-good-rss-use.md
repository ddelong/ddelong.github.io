I love RSS. I subscribe to 243 feeds. I&#8217;ve curbed my reading though, so I miss most stuff during the day. However, that doesn&#8217;t stop me from being driven nuts on a regular basis.

The first is [Day by Day](http://daybydaycartoon.com). First, it doesn&#8217;t put the comic in the feed. That alone is forgivable. Lots of comic RSS feeds do that. The problem is that new entries show up before the cartoon is uploaded. Hello? This isn&#8217;t a once in a while thing. This happens every night. Message received by this reader: I will unsubscribe and stop reading.

The second is Google&#8217;s RSS news feeds. They constantly changed the items, causing them to show up unread time and again. If they&#8217;re concerned about people seeing the full list of sources, they should link to their site instead of polluting my reader.

That is all.
