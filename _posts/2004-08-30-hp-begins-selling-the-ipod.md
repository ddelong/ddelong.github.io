Months after the announcement that they would do so, [HP](http://www.hp.com) has begun selling the iPod. Different faceplates can be gotten through HP (thought I believe they are actually sticker; I couldn't get a picture of them because I refused to wade through their flash based iPod site).

This is a win-win situation for Apple and HP. Apple spreads its market dominence while increasing public visibility. HP gets to sell an existing product (meaning no reasearch and development costs) that's already dominating the market. This allows them to sell the iPod at lower prices as well as bundle it with their own systems.

I'm not sure that there is much else to be said about it for now, but it will make the debut of Microsoft's service a little more interesting.
