Months after the announcement that they would do so, [HP](http://www.hp.com) has begun selling the iPod. Different faceplates can be gotten through HP (thought I believe they are actually sticker; I couldn&#8217;t get a picture of them because I refused to wade through their flash based iPod site).

This is a win-win situation for Apple and HP. Apple spreads its market dominence while increasing public visibility. HP gets to sell an existing product (meaning no reasearch and development costs) that&#8217;s already dominating the market. This allows them to sell the iPod at lower prices as well as bundle it with their own systems.

I&#8217;m not sure that there is much else to be said about it for now, but it will make the debut of Microsoft&#8217;s service a little more interesting.
