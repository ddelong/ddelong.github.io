[Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org) has once again updated its software offerings. The new Firefox Preview Release (PR) gives us a taste of what we can expect in the fourth quarter when the full version is released.

New features include:

  * **RSS Sensing** If the page you are visiting has set the right tags, an RSS button will appear in the status bar, listing available feeds (RSS 0.92, RSS 2.0, Atom 0.3).
  * **Live Bookmarks** Once an RSS feed is found, it is captured as a Live Bookmark. The bookmark then looks like a folder with the contents being that of the feed. Slick!
  * **Improved TypeAhead Find** which now shows an unobtrusive search bar at the bottom to help control your searching.
  * **Slight UI Improvements** Although the changes are slight, overall they much improve the experience of using Firefox. The URL slot turning beige when at a secure site is a nice touch.

Thunderbird also sports some great new features. In particular, it adds RSS feed support. You may think: _So what? You just told me about Firefox&#8217;s Live Bookmarks._ Well, hold on a second. While it&#8217;s a nice new feature, it still doesn&#8217;t address the problem of managing many feeds and keeping track of what you&#8217;ve read. Thunderbird lets you treat them like email, with each article being a message. You can make them read, move them, copy them, and even delete them. _Sweet._

**Important:** Be sure to upgrade to these versions if you already use them. They aren&#8217;t susceptible to an exploit recently announced.

As I&#8217;ve said elsewhere, I&#8217;ll be sticking with Safar, Mail, and NetNewsWire on my Mac. However, on PC&#8217;s (Windows and Linux) I&#8217;ll be using the Firefox/Thunderbird combo.
