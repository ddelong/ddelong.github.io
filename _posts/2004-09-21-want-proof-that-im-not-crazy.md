After another series of exchanges with my webhost, I&#8217;ve reduced one of the problems I&#8217;ve been having to a single PHP command.

[This](/troubleshooting/fsockopentest.php) should connect to [NOAA](http://weather.noaa.gov), disconnect, print a success statement, and finish gracefully. The source can be seen [here](/troubleshooting/fsockopentest.txt) although you may need to use your browser&#8217;s &#8220;view source&#8221; command.

PHP or Apache hangs on this simple code. If anyone has seen this before, please comment.
