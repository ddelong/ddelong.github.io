I wasn't expecting to go to even a single game this year and now I've gone to two. I saw the first game of the double header against the Seattle Mariners today with my father.

I know it was Mother's Day. Hush. The game was supposed to be last night but it got rained out. Also, dad was the one that got the tickets, so taking them a second time to see a game with someone else didn't seem appropriate.

At any rate, the single greatest high point of the game was not the fact that we won. Nor was it that the tickets were for the grand stand. No, the best part was that Bellhorn was out most of the game.

_Now if only it was permanent._
