After 4+ years of using the same awful phone, I've finally moved into the 21st century. I no longer have the classic Saved by the Bell cell phone, pictured below.

Everyone in my family got their phone upgraded to the LG VX3200. It's pretty basic (no camera or bluetooth), but it's a lot lighter and smaller than the old phone. It's also flip style, which is much better than the older style.

No more blushing when I reach to pull my phone out of my pocket in mixed company.
