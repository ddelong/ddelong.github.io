After 4+ years of using the same awful phone, I&#8217;ve finally moved into the 21st century. I no longer have the classic Saved by the Bell cell phone, pictured below.

Everyone in my family got their phone upgraded to the LG VX3200. It&#8217;s pretty basic (no camera or bluetooth), but it&#8217;s a lot lighter and smaller than the old phone. It&#8217;s also flip style, which is much better than the older style.
