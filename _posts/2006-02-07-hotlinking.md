Because Mike still doesn't have comments, I'm forced to respond over here to [another of his posts](http://www.planetmike.com/blog/2006/02/06#visits-updated). The gist of the article is that some punks at [myspace](http://www.myspace.com) were using his images on their profile pages, sucking up his bandwidth. I had the same thing happen with a punk at [Xanga](http://www.xanga.com). The conversation I had with him was:

&#8220;Hey, could you either attribute my photo or take it off your site?&#8221; (My site address was given.)

&#8220;What photo?&#8221;

&#8220;The one hosted on my site.&#8221;

&#8220;Huh?&#8221;

&#8220;This one, dumbass.&#8221;

&#8220;Huh?&#8221;

&#8220;Go to hell.&#8221;
