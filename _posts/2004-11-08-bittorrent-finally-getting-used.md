As reported on [MacCentral](http://www.macworld.com/news/2004/11/08/macgameseed/index.php/?lsrc=mcrss-1104), [MacGameSeed](http://www.macgameseed.com) is starting to distribute Mac game files via BitTorrent. [Blizzard](http://www.blizzard.com) has been doing this a little while now (primarily with the upcoming World of Warcraft beta).

It&#8217;s good to see more companies embracing this content distribution model (with [35% of the traffic on the Internet](http://in.tech.yahoo.com/041103/137/2ho4i.html) coming from BitTorrent). What I am surprised by is the lack of attention companies like [Akamai](http://www.akamai.com) have paid to it. Instead of paying these companies for mirrors for new files, they can simply set up a BitTorrent feed with a few seeds and let it rip. It may be that because BitTorrent is still a little rough around the edges for novice users (who don&#8217;t know about opening up ports to facilitate greater speeds, etc.) gives them reassurance. However, this will change (and already is, as [Azureus](http://azureus.sourceforge.net) has made some incredible strides into diagnosing performance problems for newbie users).
