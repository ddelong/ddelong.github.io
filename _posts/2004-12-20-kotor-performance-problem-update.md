To follow up on [my old post](http://godlikenerd.com/weblog/2004/12/01/knights-of-the-old-republic-performance-problems/), Brad Oliver has posted [a new beta build](http://www.brad-oliver.com:8080/~boliver/blog/archives/000606.html) of the Knights of the Old Republic game. Of particular note is that even in its current rough form, users with Radeon 8500, 9000 or 9200 cards will see double framerates. However, in some cases, this is doubling 2-3 frames per second to 6-7 FPS. I'll probably just keep playing with my Powerbook, although the initial problems have left such a bad taste in my mouth that I haven't returned to the game since discovering that fact.
