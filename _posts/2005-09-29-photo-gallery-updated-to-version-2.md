A couple weeks ago, [Gallery 2 was released](http://gallery.menalto.com/gallery_2_0_released). I&#8217;ve been using Gallery as my photo gallery software on this site for a long time. I probably would use it a lot more if [Flickr](http://flickr.com) weren&#8217;t so addictive.

The problem is that Gallery is software and not a service. Therefore, I have to supply the storage space and bandwidth. I do have well over 5 GB of storage space and 120 GB of bandwidth at my disposal (thanks [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?ddelong), which recently added unlimited domains to all their plans). I probably couldn&#8217;t consume that much space and bandwidth, but when I can upload up to 2 GB per month for $25 a year (_note to web services:_ this is a good price point) and the photos can be dowloaded unlimited times, Flickr wins out.

That said, Gallery 2 is extremely slick. They&#8217;ve moved up to using a database backend instead of a patchwork system and the install process is like butter. It&#8217;s interface is also a lot friendlier to people that simply want to browse photos. Also compelling is that you can give accounts to people, allowing them to upload on their own. You don&#8217;t have to force them into getting a Flickr account (and then set up a group/use a common tag/some other kludgy solution).

I&#8217;m thinking about adding a gallery for readers to post pictures. Anyone have any other ideas?
