After recently hinting that I had something big to share, the time has come to let everyone know what it is. [Macworld](http://www.macworld.com) has taken me on as one of two regular contributers to their new [MacUser blog](http://www.macuser.com). This is an incredible opportunity and I couldn&#8217;t be happier to be involved with this project.

I&#8217;ll be writing extremely regularly over there, though the pieces will be much, much shorter compared with my pieces here. I will be writing the occasional extended rant on MacUser, but nothing compared to here.

The downside is that as a side effect, my posting here will probably continue at its current slow pace. I originally intended to post daily here, but I&#8217;ve since figured out that&#8217;s not quite my style and I was always searching for something to comment upon, even when there wasn&#8217;t anything that really interested me. I also didn&#8217;t want to write one liners because my analysis seems to garner much more positive attention.

At any rate, check the site out if you&#8217;re interested in or use Macs. I hope to see some comments!
