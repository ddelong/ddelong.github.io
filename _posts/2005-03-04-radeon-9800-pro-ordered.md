After spending a lot time surfing the net looking for the best upgrade for my Powermac, I decided on an [ATi Radeon 9800 Pro Mac Edition video card](http://mirror.ati.com/products/radeon9800/radeon9800prome/). It's the best video that will ever work in my [Dual 1 GHz G4 Powermac](). I know you're all very excited for me.

What's even better about it, is that it will likely correct the [KotOR problems](http://godlikenerd.com/weblog/2004/12/01/knights-of-the-old-republic-performance-problems/) I was having. There was [an update](http://godlikenerd.com/weblog/2004/12/20/kotor-performance-problem-update/) that was supposed to correct it, but I was too disheartened to try it again. Besides, I barely have time for anything lately. I haven't even been playing Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

The straw that broke the camel's back as far as buying the card was the recent price change. The suggested price dropped to $250. That's not horrible, but it's not great either. I remembered that Buy.com had the card for less than $300 while it was still supposed to be $350. They had it for about $240. I did some digging and Clubmac [had it for $203.99](http://www.clubmac.com/clubmac/shop/detail.asp?dpno=260126) with free shipping. I had to pull the trigger on that. So I did.

I still have a few other things I'm eyeing to upgrade my computer with.

  * 512 MB of PC2700 DDR RAM (to bring it up to 1.75 GB)
  * SATA PCI card (a Firmtek Seritek card)
  * an SATA hard drive
  * a CPU upgrade

I'm thinking about a Western Digital Raptor or a Maxtor Diamondmax 10 drive as they were close in [a comparison at Bare Feats](http://barefeats.com/boot02.html). The speed is similar (with an edge to the Raptor), but the Maxtor drive is cheaper and much larger space wise. As for the CPU upgrade, there's a [dual 1.42 GHz upgrade](http://www.gigadesigns.com/productsM5d1214m.html), but with recent upgrades for older Macs reaching speeds of up to 1.7 GHz, I'm waiting for a similar upgrade for mine (to nearly double the clock speed).

Who wants to bankroll me?
