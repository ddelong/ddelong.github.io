I was riding on cloud 9 last night. Today was supposed to be a great day. My day was supposed to be wake up at 9, see some houses at 11, then come home and relax before Tiger arrived late afternoon or in the evening.

Everything went according to plan&#8230; except for the last part. My copy of Mac OS X Tiger got delayed for delivery by Apple. I could have driven to an Apple Store to get it, but _nooooo_, I had to tell Apple ahead of time that I wanted a copy. Rookie mistake apparently.

As a result, the series I was going to do on Tiger will be delayed and I get to stew in my sad juices.
