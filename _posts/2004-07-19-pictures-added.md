I've added pictures to my review of Radtech's ScreenSavRz as well as my entry about my new futon. I took the pictures a little bit high-res so I'll have to scale them down. Unfortunately, adding the pictures as part of the extended entry seems to be only a half-way solution as looking at June archived will bring up every entry in its entirity, including those pictures.

I wanted to avoid uploading the pictures using MovableType's built-in web upload because it's slow in pretty much every browser, but there seems to be no way to get MovableType to recognize pictures you've uploaded manually.
