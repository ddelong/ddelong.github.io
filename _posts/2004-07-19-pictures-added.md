I&#8217;ve added pictures to my review of Radtech&#8217;s ScreenSavRz as well as my entry about my new futon. I took the pictures a little bit high-res so I&#8217;ll have to scale them down. Unfortunately, adding the pictures as part of the extended entry seems to be only a half-way solution as looking at June archived will bring up every entry in its entirity, including those pictures.

I wanted to avoid uploading the pictures using MovableType&#8217;s built-in web upload because it&#8217;s slow in pretty much every browser, but there seems to be no way to get MovableType to recognize pictures you&#8217;ve uploaded manually.
