I&#8217;ve been fighting comment spam for a long time now. The majority of those sites are selling prescription drugs to fight erectile disfunction and poker sites. I long for the days when spam was ads for pornography. At least I could get some use out of that. But I digress.

These spamming sites have been mostly no name, fly-by-night outfits that don&#8217;t have a reputation to maintain. They don&#8217;t care that the public at large hates them. They make some quick profit and then die as a company.

This is the reason that you never see these companies being advertised in any other form. That is except DIRECTV. They aren&#8217;t doing it directly, but an installation partner of theirs has been busy trying to spam my blog for the last couple days. I refuse to post the URL, but for those of you that are curious the middle part of the domain (between www and com) is three words separated by dashes: direct tv online.

Due to their lack of responsibility in choosing business partners, I will never be ordering anything through them. I&#8217;m going to recommend that no one I know do so either. I&#8217;ve never been spammed by a cable company and for that, they get my continued business. DIRECTV are a bunch of scumbags for associating with these scammers. I&#8217;ve already let them know by sending an email. If you&#8217;re feeling saucy, you can do the same, or just passively let them know by never subscribing to their service.
