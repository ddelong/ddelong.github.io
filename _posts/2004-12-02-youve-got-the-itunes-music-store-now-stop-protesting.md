It&#8217;s amazing what some people will do for their [iCrack](http://www.apple.com/itunes/). Ever since Apple [announced](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2004/oct/26itmseu.html) the availability of the iTunes Music Store (iTMS) in Canada, those crazy canucks have been going crazy waiting for it.

In fact, they&#8217;ve been protesting as Bush came to town. While the mainstream media has been widely reporting that this is due to policy concerning Iraq, this is entirely wrong. Such immature angst could not be explained by anything but concerns about the iTMS being available late. It even looked like [it would be late](http://www.macworld.com/news/2004/12/01/cdnmusic/index.php), but everyone&#8217;s favorite computer company made sure that the delay was minimal, [delivering on its promise last night](http://www.macworld.com/news/2004/12/01/cdnstore/index.php), a mere day late.

So relax [Canada](http://www.trycards.com/calling-cards/Canada). You can pack up those protest signs and spend your money on the latest yodeling songs (or whatever you nutty northerners listen to).
