When I first read that [Flickr was merging accounts with Yahoo! accounts](http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2005/08/one_less_passwo.html), I thought it would be a good idea.

> As of now, anyone can log in to Flickr using their Yahoo! ID. New users will have to use their Yahoo! ID (or create a new one if they don&#8217;t have one); older users can continue to use their existing Flickr.com account details to log in, or choose to merge their Flickr.com accounts and Yahoo! IDs together*. One note: Existing users will be able to keep their existing screen names on Flickr whether they choose to merge accounts now or not &#8211; you don&#8217;t have to change your name.

Now, based upon that, nothing would be lost and I&#8217;d just be able to log in with my Yahoo! account. However, not everything was perfect.

> *Having said all that, there may be reasons why existing Flickr users would not want to associate their accounts yet: if you use API-based programs developed by outside developers, your favorite programs may not work until those developers update their programs to work with the new authentication API &#8211; many developers are already doing this, but during the transition process you&#8217;re better off to ask first and merge later!

An application I recently discovered, [1001](http://1001.kung-foo.tv/), has already been updated. If you&#8217;re an iPhoto addict though, you probably use [Frasier Spears&#8217; Flickr Export Plugin for iPhoto](http://speirs.org/flickrexport/). That plugin hasn&#8217;t been updated and authentication will fail if you merge with your Yahoo! account. I would suggest waiting this out.

**Update:** FlickrExport has been [updated to 1.3.0b1](http://www.connectedflow.com/blog/?p=9) with support for the authentication. If you were waiting for this, you can pull the trigger on the ID merge.
