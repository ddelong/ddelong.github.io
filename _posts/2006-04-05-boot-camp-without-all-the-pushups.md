If you keep your eye on Macs, you probably already know about [Boot Camp](http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/). It&#8217;s a bit of a surprise, but I suspect it was done so that users choosing to run Windows can do so in a safer manner with proper drivers. The drivers included with the new software are the key part of this announcement.

Hacking the firmware to coerce a Mac into booting Windows took a little while, but it wasn&#8217;t really all that complicated. However, putting money into a development staff for Windows drivers is quite an expensive proposition and it goes to show Apple&#8217;s commitment to leverage the move to x86 to their full benefit. They can easily scoop up fence sitters that afraid of losing the ability to run Windows.

It&#8217;s a bold move and I&#8217;m a fan.
