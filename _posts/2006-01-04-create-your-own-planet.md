I&#8217;d hope that readers of my weblog would be familiar with [Planet d00dism](http://planet.godlikenerd.com). It&#8217;s a website run with [Planet Planet](http://www.planetplanet.org) that uses my various RSS feeds to construct an aggregation of what I&#8217;m doing online (stolen wholesale from [Erik Benson](http://erikbenson.com)). There&#8217;s even an RSS feed for it. However, installing the software (which still hasn&#8217;t had a formal release), is a bit much for most people. Some don&#8217;t even have proper web hosting.

That&#8217;s why I was so excited to read that [43People has added this capability](http://www.robotcoop.com/articles/2006/01/03/add-any-rss-feed-to-your-account). By default, it includes your [43Things](http://www.43things.com), [43Places](http://www.43places.com), [43People](http://www.43people.com), and [All Consuming](http://www.allconsuming.net).

_Sidebar: Look me up on [43People](http://d00d.43people.com) and make sure you mark me as someone you know._

You can take a look at [my feeds page](http://d00d.43people.com/feeds) to see what I&#8217;ve added. The absolutely coolest feature is that if you&#8217;re a Netflix subscriber (_don&#8217;t forget you can add me as a friend there too_) and you add your activity feed, it will automatically add and update when you&#8217;re consuming and have finished consuming your movies. I used to do that manually, but then I got lazy. Now [my All Consuming page](http://www.allconsuming.net/person/d00d) is going to be regularly updated. I can tag and write entries at my leisure without worrying about forgetting to enter the movies when I get them. _Sweet._

Get an account and tell me the address so I can subscribe to your RSS feed.
