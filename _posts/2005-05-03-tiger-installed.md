I&#8217;ve got [Mac OS X Tiger](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) installed on the 12&#8243; Powerbook and the MDD G4 Powermac. Let me tell you, it&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s fast and even more multitasking capable (if that&#8217;s even really possible). I have a few quick thoughts this morning. I&#8217;ll have a much more complete analysis of [Spotlight](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/) tonight.

[Spotlight](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/) may be more like LaunchBar than I originally thought. It served as a decent replacement until I got LaunchBar installed. However, it isn&#8217;t quite the same because it groups by kind and **it doesn&#8217;t indicate location.** That&#8217;s bad because when I do a search for a certain application, Spotlight is currently bringing up duplicates that exist on my Panther backup.

[Dashboard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/) looks great. The [Flickr picture upload widget](http://zooibaai.nl/archives/2005/05/01/of-design-mac-and-flickr/) will likely make documenting features in the coming days completely trivial. I&#8217;ll have to play with it some more to see how much it actually helps me.

[.Mac Sync](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dotmacsync/) was an immediate boon. I set up my email accounts on the Powerbook and upon finishing installation on the Powermac, it magically had those email accounts configured and ready. I no longer have to worry about maintaining two independent sets of rules (which is extremely painful). This could fast become my favorite feature.

That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got for now.
