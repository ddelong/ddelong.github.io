The [Mac OS X 10.3.8 update](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macosxupdate1038.html) is out and ready for consumption. You know the drill, fire up software update, download the [delta updater](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macosxupdate1038.html), or the [combo updater](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macosxupdate1038combo.html). The delta updater weighs in at 27.7 MB and the combo is a hefty 103 MB. Software update will deliver a variable size updater dependent upon the machine you are running.

### Update Details

  * Addresses an issue with Mac OS X 10.3.7 in which iChat, Mail, or other network-based applications could take a long time to open.
  * Addresses an issue in which a computer wouldn't always restart automatically after a power failure, even when the Energy Saver preference option &#8220;Restart automatically after a power failure&#8221; was selected.
  * Improves the performance of Blizzard World of Warcraft's &#8220;Full Screen Glow&#8221; video feature.
  * Improves DVD Player compatibility when playing a movie (using certain ATI Radeon cards) to an external widescreen TV with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
  * Resolves an issue in which a &#8220;flicker&#8221; could be seen when navigating DVD menus in DVD Player on certain PowerBook G4 computers.
  * Addresses an issue in which a PowerBook G4 computer would, on rare occasion, wake from sleep with a black screen and not respond to any keyboard, mouse, or trackpad input.
  * Addresses &#8220;jumping cursor&#8221; issues that might occur when using your portable computer's trackpad with your thumb, side of thumb, or a &#8220;flat&#8221; finger.
  * Resolves an issue on certain Power Mac G5 computers where a fan cycles erratically at unexpected times, such as when Seti@home software is running.
  * Speeds up Address Book and Mail LDAP lookups that are performed by a Cisco DistributedDirector DNS server.
  * Addresses an issue that could prevent clients using the Active Directory plugin from binding to their Active Directory server.

### Observations

Mail.app seemed to load much faster for me, as was described above. I suspect that the difference lies in using a non-blocking network call. The rest largely don't affect me, especially because I don't have a _&#8220;flat&#8221; finger_.

There have been some reports that user's eject keys stop working (particularly on iBooks). However, a simple restart seems to correct that issue. It also goes to show that some people will start crying _bug!_ before taking trivial steps to make sure it's not a fluke.

Installation went fine on the 12&#8243; Powerbook, the Powermac, and the old Pismo Powerbook for me.
