From time to time, I'll be putting up protected entries (such as the [other post today](/weblog/2005/02/14/vday-surprise/)). If you want to read it, contact me.

This is mostly a measure to keep some of my more personal stories away from the general public that's probably here simply for my tech analysis. Don't feel intimidated about asking. I'll give you the password most likely.
