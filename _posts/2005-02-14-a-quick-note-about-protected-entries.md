From time to time, I&#8217;ll be putting up protected entries (such as the [other post today](/weblog/2005/02/14/vday-surprise/)). If you want to read it, contact me.

This is mostly a measure to keep some of my more personal stories away from the general public that&#8217;s probably here simply for my tech analysis. Don&#8217;t feel intimidated about asking. I&#8217;ll give you the password most likely.
