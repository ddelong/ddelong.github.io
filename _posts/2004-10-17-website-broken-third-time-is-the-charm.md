I give up.

I tried to check my football picks to see how I'm doing this week, only to be greeted with the &#8220;No data&#8221; error. Super.

I tried to get my host to do what they did last time to fix it and instead, I got the brilliant response that my website was working and that pinging it worked. This is after I referenced the old incident number where they actually figured out the problem.
