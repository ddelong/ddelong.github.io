Jon Stewart recently appeared on [CNN](http://www.cnn.com)&#8216;s [Crossfire](http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/crossfire/). As someone who's been disgusted with essentially all of this year's presidential campaign season, it was the single most refreshing appearance on TV. He challenges the hosts to answer why they are &#8220;hurting America&#8221;. They naturally dodged the question (political commentating hosts are politicians too apparently).

If you want to see it for yourself, you'll need a [BitTorrent](http://bittorrent.com) client such as my personal favorite [Azureus](http://azureus.sourceforge.net). Once you have one, you can download it in either WMV or AVI formats at [bitflood](http://bitflood.org:8080/?file=791b2f5d95a54d1381b85f271b51f71e73964185).

This interview alone, along with Jon Stewart's message has prompted me to buy [his latest book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0446532681/qid=1097955385/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-4543573-3082522?v=glance&s=books), which I suggest you do as well. It's only $15 and if you spend about $10 more, you can get free shipping. It's a small price to pay to get a great book and support someone who is an actual straight political shooter.
