Just when you think those porn pushing, pill selling, poker playing swindlers had done everything in their power to try to get into your email box (and my comment system), I get the below message:

> Hello, I&#8217;m a regular visitor to your site so i finally decided its time to sign your guestbook, so here i sign !

I assume the thought here is that I won&#8217;t notice the URL that the bot signed with and assume from the message text that it&#8217;s a real person. It does say that he is a _regular visitor_, right? Thing is, the blog isn&#8217;t a guestbook. Hell, I don&#8217;t even have a guestbook (how 90&#8217;s is that exactly?).

It is interesting that everything that they try to sell starts with a **P** though, isn&#8217;t it?
