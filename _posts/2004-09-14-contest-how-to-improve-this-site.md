I&#8217;ll give a Gmail invite to the person with the best idea on how to improve my site here. In the case that there are several really great ideas, I may give out a couple.

Valid types of ideas are:

  * Adding a WordPress plugin of some sort to my blog here.
  * Adding a new section of content.
  * Something original.

And&#8230; Go.
