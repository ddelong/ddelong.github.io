> [Netscape 7.2 improves pop-up controls, security](http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2004/08/17/netscape/?lsrc=mcrss-0804): &#8220;Netscape Communications released on Tuesday [Netscape 7.2](http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/default.jsp), an upgrade to the company's Web browser that improves control over pop-up windows and adds security enhancements. This is a free download for all users; you can also order it on CD, with a guidebook, for US$14.95. System requirements call for Mac OS X v10.1.x or higher, a G3 running at 400MHz, 256MB RAM and 60MB free hard drive space.&#8221;

Regardless of your feelings about Netscape or AOL, it's good to see new versions of this browser being released. It's also a shining example of how open-source software can used to build a commercial product.
