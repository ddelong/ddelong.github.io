[Macworld&#8217;s lab tests](http://www.macworld.com/2006/01/features/imaclabtest1/index.php?pf=1) of the new intel iMac confirm what I&#8217;ve been telling people since the Intel transition was announced.

I can summarize the results pretty quickly. Considering that the Intel processor in the new iMac is a dual core, the speed isn&#8217;t really that much better. In fact, taking that into account, it&#8217;s slower. Also, Rosetta isn&#8217;t the panacea that everyone bought into. I knew it wouldn&#8217;t be. It doesn&#8217;t work with anything that requires precise timing and it&#8217;s slow. **Slow**.

This shouldn&#8217;t be surprising, but considering what all the pundits said, you&#8217;d think it would be. I don&#8217;t think that the Intel transition will break Apple, but let&#8217;s not pretend it&#8217;s all candy and roses. It ain&#8217;t. <!-- technorati tags start -->
