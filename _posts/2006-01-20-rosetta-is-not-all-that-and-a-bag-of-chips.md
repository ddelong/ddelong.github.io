[Macworld's lab tests](http://www.macworld.com/2006/01/features/imaclabtest1/index.php?pf=1) of the new intel iMac confirm what I've been telling people since the Intel transition was announced.

I can summarize the results pretty quickly. Considering that the Intel processor in the new iMac is a dual core, the speed isn't really that much better. In fact, taking that into account, it's slower. Also, Rosetta isn't the panacea that everyone bought into. I knew it wouldn't be. It doesn't work with anything that requires precise timing and it's slow. **Slow**.

This shouldn't be surprising, but considering what all the pundits said, you'd think it would be. I don't think that the Intel transition will break Apple, but let's not pretend it's all candy and roses. It ain't. <!-- technorati tags start -->
