To be honest, I don't use [Shapeshifter](http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/shapeshifter), but I figure some of you might might be interested in a theme system for OS X. Especially recent converts, like you Katie (I did it again). [Unsanity](http://www.unsanity.com) does some great work with their haxies, despite what anyone says. I'm a big fan of [FruitMenu](http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/fruitmenu) personally.

The reason I mainly bring it up is that the image in a [recent blog entry](http://www.unsanity.org/archives/000372.php) changes (you have to force the image to reload by holding shift and clicking the reload button). So far it just changes color, but who knows what tomorrow will bring! Besides, maybe the new 2.0 version will have features that will draw me in.
