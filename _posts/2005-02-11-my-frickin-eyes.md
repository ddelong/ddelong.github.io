I have a habit of getting very little sleep during the week and sleeping excessively on the weekends. It was a system that worked great from the beginning of high school on. At some point though, this changed. If I really cut my sleep short, like less than five hours a night for several nights, my eyes start getting really irritated.

I honestly can't figure it out. First, my right eye starts to feel really itchy. I rub my eye to try to get rid of what seems to be an eyelash, only nothings really there. Naturally, it gets all red and bloodshot. _Super._ Naturally everyone notices and feels some kind of irrepressible urge to tell me. _Hey, Derik, your eyes are really bloodshot._ Gee, thanks, I had no idea. I've just been rubbing it all day because it feels so damn good. The next question is _Is that pinkeye?_ Well, I don't know, but considering I don't have any of the symptoms other than redness and an itch and that it goes away after a good night's sleep (or two), I don't think so.

Maybe I should go to the doctor at some point and get it checked out. I just lack the motivation. So I sit here this morning, hoping that getting a little more sleep between last night and tonight that my eyes will be cleared up for tomorrow.
