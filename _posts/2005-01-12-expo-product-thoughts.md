I&#8217;m going to review the new Apple product announcements inwhat I consider increasing importance.

### iLife &#8217;05

To me, this is pretty incremental. I don&#8217;t use anything in [iLife](http://www.apple.com/ilife/) (sans the free iTunes and iPhoto). Garageband fans will be overjoyed with a full 8 tracks to manipulate. At $79, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll be getting it though. I don&#8217;t need the new version of iPhoto that badly.

### iWork

Apple finally tried to update AppleWorks for the new millenium with [iWork](http://www.apple.com/iwork/) ($79). Apparently though, they only had two tickets for the trip, taking along a word processor ([Pages](http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/)) and a slideshow app ([Keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/)). Spreadsheets and database manipulation were sadly left at the station with their heads hanging dejectedly. Pages looks really cool, like a publishing application more than a wordprocessor. However, if I&#8217;m going to have an office suite, I want a speadsheet application. End of story.

### iPod shuffle

At first, I really disliked the [iPod](http://www.igroupmac.org/tag/ipod) shuffle. There&#8217;s no screen and very limited storage. However, at $99 (for 512 MB, 1GB for $149), it&#8217;s got that small price feel to it. It&#8217;s almost to the point of an impulse buy. It&#8217;s certainly ideal for running or working out because it can&#8217;t skip and one generally doesn&#8217;t stare at the screen during those activities. What began to sell it to me was that it was basically the size of a USB thumb drive. In fact, it can be used as one. Combine that with the fact that my 512 MB thumb drive cost a little less than $200 when I got it, these things are pretty useful and a value. Would I give up my iPod for one of these? Hell no. For some people though, it might be just the ticket. I&#8217;d seriously consider getting one if I needed a new thumb drive.

### Mac mini

_Oooooh._ The [first ever sub $500 Mac](http://www.apple.com/macmini/). Overall, I like it. The [specs](http://www.apple.com/macmini/specs.html) are:

  * 1.25/1.42 GHz G4 processor
  * 256 MB RAM
  * Radeon 9200 with 32 MB VRAM
  * 40/80 GB hard drive
  * Firewire 400 port
  * Two USB 2.0 ports
  * DVI port (with VGA adapter)
  * 10/100BASE-T Ethernet
  * 56k modem
  * Headphone port
  * Optional Airport Extreme and Bluetooth

Those specs are a perfect fit for my father (who is still using a rapidly aging Powermac 7600 with an upgrade card). Well, the RAM I&#8217;d have to bump up to at least 512 MB. The problem is, the one slot it seems to have isn&#8217;t user accessible. The details on this aren&#8217;t clear yet, but I&#8217;m hoping that it won&#8217;t actually require an Apple tech installation. It&#8217;s a nice low cost machine for those that may still have a monitor, keyboard and mouse. The keyboard and mouse aren&#8217;t even included (which is fine by me as I&#8217;d rather use my iceKey and Intellimouse Explorer anyway). It seems like the perfect computer to draw in some more Windows users. We&#8217;ll just have to wait and see how it does.
