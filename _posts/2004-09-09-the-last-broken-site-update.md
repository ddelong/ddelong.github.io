At least, I hope this is.

After finding a couple test entries successfully entered in my test installation, I tried it on my own and I confirmed posting works again. Well, that to me said that the problem was fixed. I added my weather plugin back and guess what. That's right, it worked and it didn't break the site.

Remember this day, because this is normal operation and proof positive that WordPress works and the code isn't broken.

Jon, I appreciated your offer even though it wasn't needed. Send me that email. I have a couple GMail invites kicking around if you want it.
