At least, I hope this is.

After finding a couple test entries successfully entered in my test installation, I tried it on my own and I confirmed posting works again. Well, that to me said that the problem was fixed. I added my weather plugin back and guess what. That&#8217;s right, it worked and it didn&#8217;t break the site.

Remember this day, because this is normal operation and proof positive that WordPress works and the code isn&#8217;t broken.

Jon, I appreciated your offer even though it wasn&#8217;t needed. Send me that email. I have a couple GMail invites kicking around if you want it.
