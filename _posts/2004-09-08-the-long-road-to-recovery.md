Last night, I put in a completely isolated new installation of WordPress in. I made a new database, didn't change anything but the configuration files necessary to point at the database. WordPress still shit the bed when trying to post new entries. All I can say is, at least they still go through.

I'm waiting help from my host and hopefully I'll get things back in working order soon (especially since I'd like to put my weather plug in back).
