Looking through my [del.icio.us inbox](http://del.icio.us/inbox/d00d) I came across a link to the [Gizmo Project](http://www.gizmoproject.com). Basically, it's a nice face for the [SIP protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol), similar to Skype (though Skype doesn't use SIP).

Skype has always served me well (though I've admittedly only played with it). It's a good OS X citizen, sporting a great interface and utilizing some neat OS X software like [Growl](http://growl.info). However, you have to pay for the voicemail service. You don't have to with Gizmo (an interim name). Gizmo has both a Mac and Windows version. A Linux version is in the works.

Anyway, I'll be playing with it. If you want to download and give me a call, drop me a line so I can prep myself.
