The new comment spam plug-in automatically tracks caught spam statistics. Before that I used WP-Blacklist, which worked pretty well. Now for the shocking data. It caught over **2900** spam comments (doesn't include spam trackbacks). With that number recorded, I will now delete them as the mail notifications of them take up 2.9 MB. Yikes.
