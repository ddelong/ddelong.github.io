My server is acting wonky again. I've sent my fourth request for service to my webhost. This is a downward spiral. If anyone knows of a good cheap host with support for PHP, MySQL, Perl scripts, Python scripts, etc. (basically the works), please drop me a line. This is getting out of hand.

On a happier note, unbeknownst to me, my website has been linked to by [MacSurfer](http://www.macsurfer.com). In particular, [my entry on Jef Raskin](http://godlikenerd.com/weblog/2004/10/22/jef-raskin-not-a-guy-you-invite-to-parties/) has been picked out (which I did not expect when I wrote it). That would explain the exceedingly large number of comments I've been getting (including some rather angry/vengeful ones, go me). If I can get this kind of response simply by saying I wouldn't want someone at a party, I might pass out if I try to think about how many hits I'll get by actually criticizing someone in a meaningful way.

I'm also uploading some pictures to the [photo gallery](http://godlikenerd.com/v-web/gallery/) tonight. Pictures of hanging out at my friend Andy's place. _Sweet._ They should be ready later tonight.
