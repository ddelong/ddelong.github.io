Just a quick one today. I'm sure most people have already heard of [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) and so had I, but up until recently I hadn't done anything with it. The buzz is well deserved. They fully support RSS, Creative Commons, as well as a million other features. I've barely scratched the surface. They'll always have a free version in addition to premium accounts. I'll probably stick with [Gallery](http://gallery.menalto.com) for some time to come, but this is definitely a more than worthy replacement for [WebShots](http://www.webshots.com). So boys and girls, put up some pictures and let me see the goods.
