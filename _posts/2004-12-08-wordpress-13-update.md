Much like most of the [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) community, I&#8217;ve been waiting with baited breath for the release of 1.3. I&#8217;d all but forgotten about it until I recently discovered [Blogsome](http://blogsome.com) in an attempt to get [Dana](http://xandriamd87.blogspot.com) into a quality blogging package.

Blogsome is a little known free blogging site. And it&#8217;s run with WordPress 1.3 software. They even give you your own subdomain name in the format: yourname.blogsome.com. How sweet is that?

At any rate, seeing the new features in 1.3 resparked my interest. I know it&#8217;s only a matter of time before it&#8217;s released (and hopefully soon). As such, I&#8217;ve put up a [testing installation](/test/). It&#8217;s going to be in a state of flux as far as format and looks go, but the content will be static as I simply copied the data from this 1.2.1 installation into a new database for testing.

By the time I&#8217;m finished and pending any changes in 1.3, I&#8217;ll have a complete theme that I use for my site available for use by other WordPress users.
