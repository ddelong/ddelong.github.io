Much like most of the [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) community, I've been waiting with baited breath for the release of 1.3. I'd all but forgotten about it until I recently discovered [Blogsome](http://blogsome.com) in an attempt to get [Dana](http://xandriamd87.blogspot.com) into a quality blogging package.

Blogsome is a little known free blogging site. And it's run with WordPress 1.3 software. They even give you your own subdomain name in the format: yourname.blogsome.com. How sweet is that?

At any rate, seeing the new features in 1.3 resparked my interest. I know it's only a matter of time before it's released (and hopefully soon). As such, I've put up a [testing installation](/test/). It's going to be in a state of flux as far as format and looks go, but the content will be static as I simply copied the data from this 1.2.1 installation into a new database for testing.

By the time I'm finished and pending any changes in 1.3, I'll have a complete theme that I use for my site available for use by other WordPress users.
