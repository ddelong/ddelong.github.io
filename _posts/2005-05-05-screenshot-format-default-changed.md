When I took a screenshot of Safari's contextual menu last night, I expected that it would be output as a PDF (the default format in Panther). I also wanted to take the opportunity to try out the [Flickr upload widget](http://zooibaai.nl/archives/2005/05/01/of-design-mac-and-flickr/) that I mentioned before (which is terribly slick). I wasn't sure that Flickr supported PDF, so I thought I'd have to convert the screenshot file. Much to my surprise, it was formatted as a PNG file. With that, I just went ahead and uploaded it (and it seems to have worked perfectly).
