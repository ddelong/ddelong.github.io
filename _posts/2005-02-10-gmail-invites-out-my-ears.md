A few days ago, Dana told me she had 50 [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com) invites. I naturally got a little irked as I was the one that invited her to begin with. That&#8217;s the way it goes I guess. Well, I checked today because I read that [one Gmail invite spooler](http://isnoop.net/gmailomatic.php) had over a million and a half invites to hand out. I had 50! I sent one to Bob who didn&#8217;t want to be left out and added 9 to the spooler.

Anyway, I still have 40 to give out, so just drop a comment with a valid email address if you want one. Your email address won&#8217;t be displayed publically, so don&#8217;t worry about that. If you are going to worry about it in spite of my reassurances, just send an email to gmailinvite at this domain name.
