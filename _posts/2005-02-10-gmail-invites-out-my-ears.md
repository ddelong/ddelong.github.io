A few days ago, Dana told me she had 50 [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com) invites. I naturally got a little irked as I was the one that invited her to begin with. That's the way it goes I guess. Well, I checked today because I read that [one Gmail invite spooler](http://isnoop.net/gmailomatic.php) had over a million and a half invites to hand out. I had 50! I sent one to Bob who didn't want to be left out and added 9 to the spooler.

Anyway, I still have 40 to give out, so just drop a comment with a valid email address if you want one. Your email address won't be displayed publically, so don't worry about that. If you are going to worry about it in spite of my reassurances, just send an email to gmailinvite at this domain name.
