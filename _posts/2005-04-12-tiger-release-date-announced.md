Imagine my surprise when I read of the Tiger release announcement (April 29th) showed up in [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) (which I'm only using instead of [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) because I'm at work). It was almost anticlimactic. Months and months of anticipation built to a single moment when I read that it was (nearly) here and I let out a soft _oh_.

As usual, MacCentral has done [a nice writeup](http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/04/12/tiger/index.php). I'm sure every other Mac news site will have a piece on it, so stop by then if you've got some weird aversion to MacCentral.

WIth this out, we can **finally** put to bed the stupid [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) rumors. It wasn't March 31st as originally listed, nor was it May 31st as their recent rebate suggested. The date is April 29th, so the next time around, can we _please_ ignore Amazon.com? **Please?**

Stop by the [Apple Store](http://store.apple.com) to reserve your copy and [Apple's OS X site](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) to drool over pictures and feature descriptions.
