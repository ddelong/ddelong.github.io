So, after a lot of hemming and hawing, I&#8217;ve finally gone ahead and ordered [an Elgato EyeHome](http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyehome). [Dealnews](http://www.dealnews.com) alerted me about a deal to get a [D-Link 5-port switch](http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=1&pid=69) for $10. That was a good deal, so I ordered it.

Now, I&#8217;ve been looking for a good deal on a switch to attach to my [DWL-G810 wireless bridge](http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=1&pid=241). Right now, it&#8217;s only attached to my Playstation 2. It only has a single ethernet port and because I&#8217;m too lazy to switch the cable over between the two devices.

For those not familiar, the EyeHome is a device that will facilitate the display of computer media onto a TV. In non-geek, that means you can play movies, TV shows, music, etc. on your TV without having to be near the computer. I can use my EyeTV (TiVo for my computer) which is upstairs to record things. Then I can send that data through the network to the EyeHome to display it on the TV.

Look forward to a review when it arrives (that is if I&#8217;m not to busy using it).
