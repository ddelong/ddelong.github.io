I'm trying to track down the problem with my weblog that recently cropped up. My host's support staff have largely pointed the finger back at me. I'd love to isolate the problem myself either to fix it or have a firm place to point my own finger. If you know PHP and how to debug, send me an email or comment (as long as the comments are still working).

**Update:** Now attempts to post result in thirty copies. I can't win. At least I can still post with my external editor.
