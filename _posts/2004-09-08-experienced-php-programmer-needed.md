I&#8217;m trying to track down the problem with my weblog that recently cropped up. My host&#8217;s support staff have largely pointed the finger back at me. I&#8217;d love to isolate the problem myself either to fix it or have a firm place to point my own finger. If you know PHP and how to debug, send me an email or comment (as long as the comments are still working).

**Update:** Now attempts to post result in thirty copies. I can&#8217;t win. At least I can still post with my external editor.
