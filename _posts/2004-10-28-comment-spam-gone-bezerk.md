No sooner than Peter Cohen [mentions getting more than 11,000 comment spams](http://www.tikkabik.com/archives/001195.html) than I realize that I had been hit. I previously had less than five spam comments. I now had about 50. _Ugh._

Luckily, setting WordPress to moderate comments with more than 3 links in it did the trick. Considering the success he had with [MT-Blacklist](http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/) and MovableType, I thought it was time I got [WPBlacklist](http://sm.farook.org/WPBlacklist.htm#wpblacklist) which is the equivalent for WordPress. Installation was quick and easy.

Now I just have to wait and see if it works.

**Update:** Two spam comments have been caught already. Seems to be working fine.
