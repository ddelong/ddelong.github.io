I&#8217;ve been interested in Macs since early in my teens years while I played with my family&#8217;s Quadra 660av. I had to be satisfied with that for many years with the only major upgrade that I could get my father to go along with being a fancy new 56k modem (back when the two standards were duking it out). I was happy with that even though I watched the PowerPCs come out and climb to the hundreds of MHz. This is going to date me, but today&#8217;s teens have no respect or perception of reality. They even make me ashamed to be associated with them. <!--more--> I went to 

[MacRumors](http://www.macrumors.com) to get coverage of the new release of the 2.5 GHz G5s (meanwhile I&#8217;m still thinking about the old Quadra 600av I had to use as a teen). Right now, I&#8217;m happy with my dual 1GHz G4 MDD (and my old Pismo as my laptop). Both are certainly adequate for my needs and the PowerMac exceeds them for sure (and I&#8217;m no casual user).

What&#8217;s the first thing I see in the comments abou the release? &#8220;Apple dropped the ball.&#8221; &#8220;This is weak.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m going to Alienware.&#8221; Sure, this has become standard fare for any Apple release but this time has pushed me over the edge. I&#8217;m tired of these whiny little kids with mommy and daddy&#8217;s pocketbook covering their purchases and no social lives, complaining about the stock video card in the G5s. It&#8217;s far more computer than they need or could use, but that&#8217;s not even good enough for them. I think these kids need a good hard slap up against their heads. Hard enough to break their jaw to get them to shut up.

I have the money to consider buying one of these computers and honestly, it&#8217;s just not time for me to do so. That&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re weak. It&#8217;s because the computer I have is already more than I need. It&#8217;s twice what any of these little babies need too. I may be part of Generation X, but the new generation is Generation Y(ne) (read whine).
