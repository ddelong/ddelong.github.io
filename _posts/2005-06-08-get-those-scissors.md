You're going to want to head down to your local newsstand if you're not a subscriber to Macworld magazine. The July 2005 issue features an article written by yours truly (it's the sidebar on page 46). It's already been published online, but there's nothing like a physical copy right in your hands.

I plan on buying a couple copies so I can frame it as it's my first published work. It's quite an exciting day for me. Hopefully I can make this a more regular thing.
