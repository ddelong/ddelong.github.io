You&#8217;re going to want to head down to your local newsstand if you&#8217;re not a subscriber to Macworld magazine. The July 2005 issue features an article written by yours truly (it&#8217;s the sidebar on page 46). It&#8217;s already been published online, but there&#8217;s nothing like a physical copy right in your hands.

I plan on buying a couple copies so I can frame it as it&#8217;s my first published work. It&#8217;s quite an exciting day for me. Hopefully I can make this a more regular thing.
