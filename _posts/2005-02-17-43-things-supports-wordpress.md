[Robot Co-op](http://robotcoop.com) [announced today](http://robotcoop.com/weblog/55/new-features-just-launched-cheers-cities-help-and-more) that they are supporting [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) blogs (adding to Blogger, LiveJournal, Movable Type, and Type Pad). As of this entry post time, it was still rough. The description texts are still not filled out right (making it apparent that they simply use the same method as for Movable Type, hardly a surprise), but I assume it works. This should be have been trivial for them to do (as all the major blogging packages use XML-RPC and Movable Type APIs).

At any rate, what this means for you is that if I make an entry on one of my goals that I consider significant and worthwhile to be read in 43 Things, it will get automatically posted into this blog. As of yet, I do not know how this will look, so the first time will be a surprise for both of us. If any of you write in a blog (and please tell me about yours, because I&#8217;m always interested in new stuff to read), you can do the same. Very cool.
