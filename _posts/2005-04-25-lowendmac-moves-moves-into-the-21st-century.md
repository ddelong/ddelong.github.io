I'd like to congratulate [LowEndMac](http://lowendmac.com) on moving into the era of modern web page code, using XHTML and CSS. I guess my old criticism about their website (in reference to them judging the state of web browsers in OS 9) will have to fade into the background, but considering that they recognized that iCab was deficient (putting it kindly):

> On the down side, pages may not work as well in older browsers once we fully implement our CSS design. And iCab really shows its noncompliance. But with 98-99% of our visitors using modern browsers, we figured it was time to make the switch.

It does validate my claim that iCab is indeed not a modern browser, but I'll stick that feather in my cap and call it a day.
