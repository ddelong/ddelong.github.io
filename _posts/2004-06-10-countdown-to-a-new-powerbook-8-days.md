After four great years with my Pismo, it&#8217;s time I moved on. I&#8217;ve been putting off replacing it because it&#8217;s no longer my primary computer (not since I bought a Powermac MDD a couple years back). Being a college student, beer soaked up most of my free funds and as such, a new Powerbook wasn&#8217;t a reality until now (with my fabulous software engineering job, take that outsourcing!).

Well, I&#8217;ve decided that portability is the way to go. The new Powerbook 12&#8243; looks to be a good move up from a 500 MHz G3 to a 1.33 GHz G4 (which is faster than both of the 1 GHz processors in my Powermac). With the better video card, better optical drive, Airport card, etc., it should keep me entertained (at least for 2 years). I know I&#8217;m probably buying the last Powerbook G4, but that&#8217;s ok. I made my peace with getting the last Powerbook G3 and next to last Powermac G4.

So once my Discover card rolls over next week, I&#8217;ll be ready to buy. My mother will be getting my old Pismo to play with (because my father refuses to replace the old Powermac 7600). What a son I am.
