Apple released [Mac OS](http://www.igroupmac.org/tag/mac-os) X 10.3.6 just a little while ago. Fire up Software Update or visit [the technote page for the update](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=300080), which includes links to Combo and Delta updaters. Below are the enhancements listed by Apple.

  * Safari no longer times out after 60 seconds when attempting to connect to a webpage or to submit form data. With this update, Safari will keep trying indefinitely (or until you cancel the attempt).
  * With this update, a synchronized iDisk correctly resizes .Mac storage after its allocation changes.
  * Addresses a kernel panic issue that could occur when using an external, wireless USB broadband modem with Mac OS X 10.3.5.

  * Addresses an issue that could prevent login via a network user account.
  * Resolves an issue for Mac OS X 10.3.5 in which, sometimes, network-based applications could not open an application from an automounted AFP volume, such as /Network/Applications/.
  * SMB/CIFS servers in /Network no longer suddenly disappear and reappear after the network changes.

### Applications

  * Addresses an issue that could occur when using some scholastic information management applications with Mac OS X 10.3.5; this alert could appear: &#8220;Another module has &#8216;locked' the MS Tx file. You will gain access when their task is completed.&#8221;
  * Addresses an issue in which &#8220;zooming&#8221; in Halo 1.0.5 could lead to blurry video when using certain Nvidia video cards.

  * Adds WMC connectivity capability for Nokia 7610 phones.
  * Addresses an issue for Mac OS X 10.3.5 in which some glyph fonts, certain &#8220;Expert&#8221; or &#8220;dingbat&#8221; fonts, would no longer appear in some applications.
