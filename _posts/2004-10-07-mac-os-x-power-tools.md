Thanks to my continued participation in [Macworld's Forums](http://www.macworld.com/forums/), I've gotten to know some of the Macworld writers. One of them is, of course, [Dan Frakes](http://www.danfrakes.com).

He's done me the favor of sending me a copy of his latest book, [Mac OS X Power Tools](http://www.macosxpowertools.com). It arrived in the mail to today. The sheer size of it surprised me, but I am no less determined to read it cover to cover.

Once I do, you can look forward to a thorough review.
