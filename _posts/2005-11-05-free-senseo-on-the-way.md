In case you didn&#8217;t read the link in the [supplemental](http://del.icio.us/d00d/supplement), for a picture of your coffee pot doing something unusual (I opted to fill it with Halloween candy) you get a [Senseo machine](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001ES9G2/d00dism-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1) (currently valued at $49.99). Ok, so you need to pay $15 for shipping and handling, but that&#8217;s still huge savings.

Anyway, I submitted my photo and it was accepted this morning. It won&#8217;t ship for 4-6 weeks due to high demand (geez, free $50 device, who thought that&#8217;d be popular?). I can&#8217;t wait so my lazy ass can have coffee every morning.
