Between upgrading to WordPress 1.5, adopting a new page layout, moving Scott and Bob's blog data into a separate database, and rebuilding my blog database, I've reduced the page generation time from well over a second (sometimes close to two seconds) to a mere third of a second (for the main page).

It should feel like the entire site is flying now. Things may bog down as I customize, but it was still a nice little surprise.
