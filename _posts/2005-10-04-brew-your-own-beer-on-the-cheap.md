I&#8217;ve always wanted to [brew my own beer](http://www.43things.com/things/view/342). Well, I have at least as long I made beer my drink of choice. Lately, I&#8217;ve been on a real wine kick, but when I saw [a beer brewing kit for $20](http://www.after5catalog.com/product.aspx?ID=248-05019).

It includes **everything** you need, even bottles, which usually one has to recycle from other beers they&#8217;ve consumed in a drunken marathon (I imagine). You&#8217;ll need to add $6.95 for shipping, but considering how low the price is, that&#8217;s acceptable. It&#8217;s also possible to get additional beer variety canisters from [the manufacturer](http://mrbeer.com) (with a name like Mr. Beer, you know it must be good), should you decide that your beer didn&#8217;t taste like ass.

Cheers.
