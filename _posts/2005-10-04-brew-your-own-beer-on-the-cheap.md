I've always wanted to [brew my own beer](http://www.43things.com/things/view/342). Well, I have at least as long I made beer my drink of choice. Lately, I've been on a real wine kick, but when I saw [a beer brewing kit for $20](http://www.after5catalog.com/product.aspx?ID=248-05019).

It includes **everything** you need, even bottles, which usually one has to recycle from other beers they've consumed in a drunken marathon (I imagine). You'll need to add $6.95 for shipping, but considering how low the price is, that's acceptable. It's also possible to get additional beer variety canisters from [the manufacturer](http://mrbeer.com) (with a name like Mr. Beer, you know it must be good), should you decide that your beer didn't taste like ass.

Cheers.
