Katie posted [another quiz](http://www.livejournal.com/users/kayteebird/33345.html) from the same site as the last. Seeing as the question was &#8220;What part of Thanksgiving are you?&#8221; and that it's a mere few days away, I couldn't resist.

<table width="400" align="center" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#66CCFF" align="center">
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" style='color:black; font-size: 14pt;'><b>You Are the Stuffing</b></font>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
      <img src="http://www.quizdiva.net/bt/stuffing.jpg" alt="Stuffing" /><font color="#000000"><br />You're complicated and complex, yet all your pieces fit together.<br />People miss you if you're gone &#8211; but they're not sure why.</font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div align="center">
  <a href="http://www.blogthings.com/thanksgivingquiz.html">What Part of Thanksgiving Are You?</a>
