Yes, it&#8217;s geeky and there isn&#8217;t really much defending it, but my new favorite show is anime. It airs Thursday and Saturday nights on [Adult Swim](http://www.adultswim.com). Check their website for current showtimes.

<img src="/images/winry.jpg" alt="Winry" title="The New Love" class ="float-left" />The show of course is [Fullmetal Alchemist](http://www.adultswim.com/shows/fullmetal/). It&#8217;s about a pair of brothers extremely interested in alchemy, the science of making anything as long as you have the correct ingredients. They try revive their mother using this science/art, which is forbidden. They find out why. The older brother loses two limbs while the younger loses his entire body, being bonded to some empty armor.

The main reason I love the show though is the character, Winry (as seen to the left). Blonde, cute, smart, and mechanically inclined (she made Ed&#8217;s automail limbs), she&#8217;s everything a good geek like me looks for in a woman. Well, except of course being flesh and blood or non-fictional, but relationships are all about compromise. I&#8217;m willing to forgive those traits.
