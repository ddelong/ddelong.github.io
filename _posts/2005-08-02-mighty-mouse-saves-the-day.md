I&#8217;m not as surprised as much as I would have been prior to the Macintel announcement, but I still didn&#8217;t expect to see this happen. Apple is making a multi-button mouse with a scroll interface, the [Mighty Mouse](http://www.apple.com/mightymouse/) [[Amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007Y79E4/d00dism-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1)]. It doesn&#8217;t look to be a wheel, but a little nub. Apple&#8217;s site mentions rolling though.

> Mighty Mouse offers 360-degree scrolling capability, thanks to its Scroll Ball, perfectly positioned to roll smoothly under just one finger.

I&#8217;ll need to get one for myself to play with (because I doubt I&#8217;ll like it more than my Logitech MX1000) so I can figure it out. Is it a mini trackball? A nub? Please let it not be a nub. My finger hurts just think about them.

What&#8217;s really interesting is that it&#8217;s not a generic three-button mouse. Apple seems to have jumped headfirst by including side buttons, which act as a fourth button. At $50, it has the same suggested retail price as a [Logitech MX518](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007Z1M50/d00dism-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1) but will likely stay at that price unlike the Logitech, which can be had for $40 right now.

At any rate, this is likely to satisfy many people that have been crying for years for an Apple branded multi-button mouse. The downsides are the price, no fancy optics, and lack of a bluetooth version (big _boo_ for that one). Hopefully Apple will start offering an option to switch out the regular mouse for this on new systems (for a discounted price of $20 or so) or even be so bold as to make it the standard mouse for Powermacs, leaving the single button for the iMacs and eMacs.

**Update:** It even makes noises when scrolling. _Cute!_

**Update 2:** Amazon has it available for pre-order. <!--more-->
