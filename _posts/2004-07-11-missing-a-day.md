All right, I don't have a good excuse. I didn't write yesterday. To make up for it, I'll post twice today.

Last night, I finished [Call of Duty](http://www.callofduty.com). Ok, ok, I practically played through the entire game. My summary, which has already been mirrored by others like Peter Cohen of Macworld and Maccentral fame. Excellent game, great play, good levels, but too short. I want more! Essentially all the levels were interesting and fun. I'm glad there was no sniper level, a la Medal of Honor. Was it worth the $50? Yes, I believe so. I now have a lot of replay value through playing at greater difficulties and multi-player play.

The game itself is very similar to Medal of Honor, with several key differences. Allied Assault lacked the ability to melee. Spearhead changed this, but at the cost of a lot of speed. Call of Duty is fast. It seems to play smoother than any other game (save for old favorites like the first Aliens vs. Predator). This was rather surprising for me because its requirements are rather high. In fact, they seem to exceed my brother's flap panel iMac, but from what I've read, it plays great on them.

If you're looking for a great game for your Mac (or PC \*shiver\*) look at Call of Duty, it's worth at least a demo download.
