Rather than post separate entries, I thought I&#8217;d explain why I haven&#8217;t been around with one.

### Visiting Hours

My friend Scott finally freed up some time to see the new place, which he now calls a sweet setup. I&#8217;m inclined to agree.

He came out Friday night and got the full tour. Naturally, the four floors of my place were a high point. So far, no one has really had a bad word, but then again maybe they&#8217;re all being polite and saving the criticism for later.

He stayed until this morning, allowing us to catch up and even figure out that the nearest theater (in Lowell) wasn&#8217;t all that far. Given, it can&#8217;t beat the theater just 5 minutes down the street in Northborough, but it&#8217;ll do.

Anyway, entertaining makes it hard to keep up with the online life (among other things, read on).

### Waterworks

I spent most of the day helping father pull his boat out of the water. Ok, it took all day. My dad didn&#8217;t realize that at high tide, the ramp&#8217;s slope is really slight and as such, the trailer doesn&#8217;t get deep enough into the water to drive up on. That forced us to wait several hours.

I did get a footlong meatball sub out of it, so it&#8217;s not all bad, but it did prevent me from doing certain things today (read on).

### And the Lights Went Out

So I decided to check some directions while Scott was dropping a nasty deuce into one of my toilets. I opened up my laptop to see the screen blink on and then off. That&#8217;s right, the screen died.

Being the troubleshooting wizard I am, I started going through things that would help (hopefully).

  1. Shut down and started the computer. **Nada.**
  2. Pressed the brightness keys. **Nada.**
  3. Shut down the computer for an hour while at breakfast. **Nada.**
  4. Reset the PRAM (waited for three dongs). **Nada.**
  5. Reset the power manager. **Nada.**
  6. Connected an external display.

The external display worked correctly, but when I visited Displays in System Preferences, only the external display was listed. Not good. System Profiler implies that the display is disconnected/off. In the words of Andy&#8217;s Dad, _we are fucked, completely and utterly fucked._

I wanted to take it in Saturday to the Apple Store, but with Scott around, that seemed rude. I waited until Sunday, but I got back really late, so that was out. I&#8217;ll have to go tomorrow after work because I can&#8217;t live without the mobility. Sure, the desktop is certainly essential, but life sucks without my trusty Powerbook.

I&#8217;ll have to hope that I can afford the repair bill (and obligatory [Amazon page plug](/shop/)). Oh, and thanks to whoever bought that big screen TV. I love you!
