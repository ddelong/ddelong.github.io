Living in Massachusetts makes my vote largely impotent (thanks to our electoral college system). This year I think I'll be voting Libertarian because ideally, that's how I'd want to vote anyway.

Slashdot has a story on [asking the Libertarian candidate some questions](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/13/1249231). This should be fairly interesting and anyone that has been entertaining thoughts of voting Libertarian should probably take a swing and ask a question.
