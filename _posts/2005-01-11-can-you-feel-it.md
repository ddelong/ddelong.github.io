The Macworld Expo San Francisco keynote is less than 4 hours away. The whole Mac community is waiting with baited breath. Personally, I want to find out more about Tiger. In particular, a release date more specific than &#8220;first half of 2005&#8221; and hopefully sooner rather than later.

We also get to find out which rumors were worth something. The current most popular rumors are:

  * _iWork_ Apple&#8217;s new office suite
  * _flash-based iPod_
  * _headless iMac_ the $500 Mac
  * _Mac OS X Tiger_ info and release date
  * _Powerbook updates_ with slightly faster processors

I still don&#8217;t get the head-popping excitement being generated by the flash-based iPod. Shortly after the keynote is done, I&#8217;ll do a quick summary. Later tonight, I&#8217;ll do my little rant on what all the news will mean for the future.
