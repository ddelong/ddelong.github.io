> [Backstage: 42% report 4G iPod audio problems](http://backstage.ipodlounge.com/index.php?id=P4753): &#8220;Exclusively for Backstage readers: This is an advance version of a news story that will appear on the main iPodlounge web site tomorrow morning. Having problems with your fourth-generation (4G) iPod? You&#8217;re not alone. Three weeks after the release of Apple&#8217;s newest iPods, iPodlounge readers have reported that approximately 42% of their 4G units have manifested an audio defect identified by iPodlounge, while others have complained of receiving soiled or physically damaged hardware&#8230;.&#8221;

Normally I wouldn&#8217;t call attention to this, but considering [a recent post by a Macworld editor](http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/editors/archives/000283.php?lsrc=editorsblog-0804), I fear this problem really is common. I&#8217;m still using my 3G iPod which has been serving me wonderfully.
