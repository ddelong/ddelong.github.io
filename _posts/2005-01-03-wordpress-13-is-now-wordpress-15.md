Following what could best be described as absolute confusion for its users, the WordPress developers have [clarified that WordPress 1.3 will be known as WordPress 1.5](http://wordpress.org/development/2004/12/version-skip/) due to extensive changes. It's completely a placebo effect, but I feel a little more comfortable waiting for WordPress 1.5 instead of 1.3. True, it's the same thing ultimately, but I'm feeling better.

In related news, they've also released a pre-release version of their upcoming bulletin board software, [bbPress](http://bbpress.org). I may just move over to it once a more formal version is released as PHPbb is overkill for what I need (due to extremely low volume).

Also, I resolve to post more. Being on vacation has sapped me of all motivation.
