Cory Doctorow wrote [a piece on why he won&#8217;t be buying an iPad](http://www.boingboing.net/2010/04/02/why-i-wont-buy-an-ipad-and-think-you-shouldnt-either.html) (which extends to why you shouldn&#8217;t either. I don&#8217;t agree with his article, but the vehement arguments against some of his have been equally asinine.

Joel Johnson wrote [an otherwise brilliant piece](http://gizmodo.com/5508286/cory-doctorow-you-are-a-consumer-too) that says:

> So what if you can&#8217;t make iPad programs on an iPad. I don&#8217;t complain I can&#8217;t make new dishwashers with my dishwasher.

Doctorow doesn&#8217;t outright call this out as an issue, but it fits with the theme of what he wrote. The problem is this is analogy is flawed. Let&#8217;s see if you can tell the problem with it if I put it in mathematical format.

iPad programs : iPad :: dishwasher : dishwasher

It becomes rather clear, doesn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s essentially saying that iPad programs are iPads unto themselves. Let&#8217;s make it even worse.

Apologies to Dan Jalkut (I love MarsEdit; don&#8217;t hate me), but [this gem](http://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/11501859108) is even worse.

> &#8220;You can&#8217;t write apps for the device.&#8221; Yeah, and you can&#8217;t publish a book with a book. Or write a pen with a pen.

Joel&#8217;s analogy almost worked because he started talking about appliances. It goes wrong from there, but the groundwork is there. The above is just wrong from the get-go.

This isn&#8217;t to say I agree with the concept. Is it important to be able to develop iPad applications using an iPad? No. The ability to create content for a platform using the platform itself isn&#8217;t important. It&#8217;s really not. Computers are one of the few (if only?) devices that do this extensively. Let&#8217;s use some other (slightly more valid) analogies to argue against this idea.

You can&#8217;t make PS3 games using a PS3. You can&#8217;t make movies using a Bluray player. It&#8217;s easy. I&#8217;m sure you can come up with some as well.

The fact is that for consumer devices (which the iPad is), it&#8217;s not important to be able to develop content for it with the device itself. I agree with you. But I&#8217;m also begging you all to stop using bad analogies to argue this truth.
