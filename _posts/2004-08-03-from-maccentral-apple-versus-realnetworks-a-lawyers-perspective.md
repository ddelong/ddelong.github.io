[Apple versus RealNetworks: A lawyer&#8217;s perspective](http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2004/08/03/legal/)

My interpretation of this whole situation? Apple should let Real do whatever it is planning, but use of those files will be completely unsupported by Apple. Users are on their own if they decide to use them (or Real can do the support work). Additionally, Apple doesn&#8217;t make any guarantees about future firmware working, so if the files stop playing, Apple can say &#8220;Talk to Real&#8221;.

Seems like a fair compromise to me.
