I&#8217;ve been getting linked and written to like crazy for [Tag Central](/tagcentral/). I added [BlogMarks](http://blogmarks.net), a very neat link site with thumbnails (thanks to [Stuart](http://www.blethers.com) for pointing it out to me).

That makes the current list of supported sites:

  * [BlogMarks](http://blogmarks.net)
  * [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us)
  * [Furl](http://www.furl.net)
  * [Jots](http://www.jots.com)
  * [Flickr](http://flickr.com)
  * [Smugmug](http://www.smugmug.com)
  * [43 Things](http://43things.com)
  * [Tagsurf](http://tagsurf.com)

### Next on the Agenda

  * More sites! I&#8217;m trying to track down more tag using sites. If you know of one that I haven&#8217;t added yet, [let me know](/contact/).
  * Administrative links at the bottom of the page. I&#8217;ll have to make about and contact pages at the very least. I&#8217;ll also link all the included services.
  * Automated cleanup. I haven&#8217;t yet tackled the issue of cached data, but I&#8217;ll be doing so soon.
  * Related tags. Matt at Oddiophile shared his related tags code and I&#8217;ll have to see how it works and preface the results with possibly related tags.
  * Its own domain name.

### A Domain by any Other Name

I&#8217;ll admit that &#8220;Tag Central&#8221; isn&#8217;t the most imaginative name for the page. I like [Taggregator](http://oddiophile.com/taggregator/), but I can&#8217;t use that. I&#8217;m not terribly imaginative here, but I want the name (and domain name) to be cool. Suggest something groundbreaking! When I make the move to [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com), I get a free domain name, so I want to make it a good one.
