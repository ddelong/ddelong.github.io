Was making [the movie Zathura](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406375/) necessary? Really? It&#8217;s about a couple boys who find a board game that propels their house into a space adventure. Does that sound familiar? That&#8217;s Jumanji, except in space instead of the jungle.

Well, that&#8217;s not entirely accurate. There&#8217;s no [Robin Williams](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000245/), or even young, hot, [Kirsten Dunst](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000379/). Instead, we have [Dax Shepard](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1009277/) (I&#8217;ve never heard of him either) and two young boys. Oh, and [Tim Robbins](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000209/). I can understand the younger actors getting involved, but Tim Robbins. I should send this, if I had his address.

In all fairness, this actually a sequel of sorts to Jumanji, but didn&#8217;t we get our fill of that plot in the first movie? Is there an original idea in all of California? Based upon the script ideas in [Query Letters I Love](http://queryletters.blogspot.com/), it doesn&#8217;t seem like it. Hell, this summer was all remakes and sequels.

There&#8217;s a reason I&#8217;ve seen a single movie in theaters in the last three months. It&#8217;s not because it&#8217;s expensive (that only helps).
