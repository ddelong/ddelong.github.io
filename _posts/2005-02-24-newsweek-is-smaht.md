Tonight on Dennis Miller, Gersh Kuntzman of Newsweek appeared on the Varsity discussion panel. I didn't get a chance to get the entire quote but he said about Arnold Schwarzenegger:

> He speaks Austrian better than&#8230;.

Apparently, Austria has decided to rid itself of the German language and adopted its own new language. I'll have to subscribe to Newsweek because I'm missing some major stories.
