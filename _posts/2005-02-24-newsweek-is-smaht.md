Tonight on Dennis Miller, Gersh Kuntzman of Newsweek appeared on the Varsity discussion panel. I didn&#8217;t get a chance to get the entire quote but he said about Arnold Schwarzenegger:

> He speaks Austrian better than&#8230;.

Apparently, Austria has decided to rid itself of the German language and adopted its own new language. I&#8217;ll have to subscribe to Newsweek because I&#8217;m missing some major stories.
