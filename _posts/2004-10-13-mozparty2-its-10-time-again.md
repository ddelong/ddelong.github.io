> [mozparty2: It&#8217;s 1.0 time&#8230; again!](http://www.openforce.at/mozparty2/) Remember the Mozilla 1.0 Release? Mozilla supporters were partying all over the world! But now, it&#8217;s 1.0 time again &#8211; for Firefox and Thunderbird! Join the parties and help making the next browser statistics way different ðŸ™‚
Needless to say, I find the impending Firefox 1.0 release very exciting. What&#8217;s even more exciting is the number of people I&#8217;ve turned on to it and can no longer stand Internet Explorer. Take _that_, subspace.

There&#8217;s only a single party planned in the US currently (in Indiana), but I&#8217;m sure more will be planned soon enough. I&#8217;d think about hosting one, but one, I&#8217;m no good at planning parties and two, that&#8217;s too geeky.
