> [mozparty2: It's 1.0 time&#8230; again!](http://www.openforce.at/mozparty2/) Remember the Mozilla 1.0 Release? Mozilla supporters were partying all over the world! But now, it's 1.0 time again &#8211; for Firefox and Thunderbird! Join the parties and help making the next browser statistics way different ðŸ™‚
Needless to say, I find the impending Firefox 1.0 release very exciting. What's even more exciting is the number of people I've turned on to it and can no longer stand Internet Explorer. Take _that_, subspace.

There's only a single party planned in the US currently (in Indiana), but I'm sure more will be planned soon enough. I'd think about hosting one, but one, I'm no good at planning parties and two, that's too geeky.
