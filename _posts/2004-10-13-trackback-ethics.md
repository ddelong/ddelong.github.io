> [Trackback Ethics](http://www.elliottback.com/blog/?postid=127) But this isn&#8217;t about squabbling between bloggers. I&#8217;m more interested in the question, &#8220;What is trackback for?&#8221; or &#8220;What is ethical Trackback?&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure. From what I&#8217;ve read, Trackback is just a ping to tell someone that you&#8217;ve written / blogged / quoted something similar or on the same topic (Wikipedia). I was continuing Scoble&#8217;s discussion of blog promotion. I tracked back discussions of it. Was that wrong?
Elliott Back asks some interesting questions about trackbacks. I think the concept and its appropriateness is all too often not explained well. I&#8217;m new to the blogging game so I won&#8217;t pretend to know everything. I will say that this problem is likely to get much worse as blogging packages are becoming increasingly accessible to laymen. It might be time for blogging package makers to take a little responsibility to explain these concepts better to new users.
