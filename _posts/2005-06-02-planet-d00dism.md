After thinking a lot about how to implement my own [Erikkregator](http://hello.erikbenson.com/), [Marshall](http://marshallk.blogspot.com) recommended [RSSMix](http://www.rssmix.com). Now, that was an excellent suggestion. However, that only solves the problem of the RSS feed. I wanted to have a webpage to go along with it though.

At that point, if I was going to be programming with an RSS parsing library, I might as well be mixing my own RSS feed. That sounded extremely painful though. That's why I was glad to come across a slick piece of software called [Planet](http://www.planetplanet.org/).

They describe their software as:

> Planet is a flexible feed aggregator. It downloads news feeds published by web sites and aggregates their content together into a single combined feed, latest news first.
> 
> It uses Mark Pilgrim's Universal Feed Parser to read from RDF, RSS and Atom feeds; and Tomas Styblo's templating engine to output static files in any format you can dream up.

This software will take a series of feeds, and combine them into web pages and feeds. You can template any kind of output you can dream up. Now, I had seen the software used at [Planet WordPress](http://planet.wordpress.org), but based on what I'd seen, it didn't look like there were any feeds. They neither linked them or put the appropriate tags into the head. There's no way to tell there are feeds (if there are in fact any).

Well, I set it up for my very own [Planet d00dism](http://planet.godlikenerd.com). Check it out. It's still not quite ready for primetime. I need to make the feeds more easily available as well as give it my own special visual touch. Yeah, it'll probably look like ass, but it'll look like my ass (which is _bootylicious_). I also ran into a little problem with Netflix's activity feed. I'll save an in-depth discussion of that and its solution for a later entry though.

_Tune in later, same bat page, same bat feed._
