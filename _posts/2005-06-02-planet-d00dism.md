After thinking a lot about how to implement my own [Erikkregator](http://hello.erikbenson.com/), [Marshall](http://marshallk.blogspot.com) recommended [RSSMix](http://www.rssmix.com). Now, that was an excellent suggestion. However, that only solves the problem of the RSS feed. I wanted to have a webpage to go along with it though.

At that point, if I was going to be programming with an RSS parsing library, I might as well be mixing my own RSS feed. That sounded extremely painful though. That&#8217;s why I was glad to come across a slick piece of software called [Planet](http://www.planetplanet.org/).

They describe their software as:

> Planet is a flexible feed aggregator. It downloads news feeds published by web sites and aggregates their content together into a single combined feed, latest news first.
> 
> It uses Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s Universal Feed Parser to read from RDF, RSS and Atom feeds; and Tomas Styblo&#8217;s templating engine to output static files in any format you can dream up.

This software will take a series of feeds, and combine them into web pages and feeds. You can template any kind of output you can dream up. Now, I had seen the software used at [Planet WordPress](http://planet.wordpress.org), but based on what I&#8217;d seen, it didn&#8217;t look like there were any feeds. They neither linked them or put the appropriate tags into the head. There&#8217;s no way to tell there are feeds (if there are in fact any).

Well, I set it up for my very own [Planet d00dism](http://planet.godlikenerd.com). Check it out. It&#8217;s still not quite ready for primetime. I need to make the feeds more easily available as well as give it my own special visual touch. Yeah, it&#8217;ll probably look like ass, but it&#8217;ll look like my ass (which is _bootylicious_). I also ran into a little problem with Netflix&#8217;s activity feed. I&#8217;ll save an in-depth discussion of that and its solution for a later entry though.

_Tune in later, same bat page, same bat feed._
