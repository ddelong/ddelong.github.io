It's but a few days since Apple released the [Mac mini](http://www.apple.com/macmini/) and we already have a product from another cool company with a similar (ok, exactly the same) name. Google has [released the Google Mini](http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/honey-we-shrunk-google.html).

Before you plunk down $4,995 to get one of these neat blue boxes, you have to know that this isn't a consumer device. Rather, it's a server to index a business's documents and facilitate searches of those documents.

> The Google Mini can provide search for up to 50,000 documents, and it supports over 220 different file types. The price includes 1 year of full customer support, software updates, and replacement coverage.

If you still want one, you can [get it](http://www.googlestore.com/appliance/GO0123.asp) off their [online store](http://www.googlestore.com). The store actually has some cool stuff for consumers like Google and Blogger branded clothes and even [stress goo](http://www.googlestore.com/product.asp?catid=2&code=GO0096)!
