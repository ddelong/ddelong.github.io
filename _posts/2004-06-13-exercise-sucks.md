Bob dragged me to the gym in my junior year (as I had no excuse not to go). In the months that followed, my body finally got into shape and made me worthy of the title &#8220;Greek God.&#8221; Unfortunately, in the summer that followed, instead of the usual manual labor I did for a job, I got an internship at Raytheon, giving me a taste of office life.

I got lazy. I stopped going to the gym because work took up so much of my time during the day. My girlfriend at the time didn't care and neither did I. When I got back to school, I thought I could get back into working out. I did for a while, until senior year pressure got to me. Most of my time was focused on schoolwork and the little time I had left over I spent on the &#8216;puter.

Well, now that I'm single again (no, that had nothing to do with no longer working out) and soft, I feel it's time I took up the barbell again. Not only am I going to lift weights this time, but I've decided to run too. I started today by running about a mile and a half followed by half an hour of lifting weights. Given, my iPod made it a little more enjoyable, but working out alone is terrible. There's no one there to motivate you. No one to get you started. Without that motivation, I don't feel like doing it again, which is a bad thing.
