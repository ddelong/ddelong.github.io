Address Book has some neat built-in features. Some are more hidden than others. Most people find that by clicking on addresses, a menu will pop up offering to bring up a map for that address. Very cool. What is not cool is that it uses [MapQuest](http://www.mapquest.com).

Let me revise that. I don't like MapQuest. It's a pain to work with. I like [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com). Wouldn't it be nice if you could use it instead? You can with the [Google Maps Plugin](http://www.briantoth.com/addressbook/) (donationware).

Not only will it bring up addresses in Google Maps, but it will also assist in finding directions between any two entries or custom addresses you write in.

[![Address Book Menu](http://photos21.flickr.com/30114125_55fa8de4f0_t.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/19959606@N00/30114125 "Address Book Menu")[![Directions](http://photos23.flickr.com/30114308_d346654e35_t.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/19959606@N00/30114308 "Directions")

It even sports its own preferences, allowing for customizations that will assist in making the address shown more accurate (by blocking out apartment numbers and the like). If you enjoy Brian's terrific work, let him know with a donation.
