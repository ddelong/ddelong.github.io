Tiger users can user Jabber usernames with iChat AV 3.0. What&#8217;s the point of that? Well, AOL can&#8217;t listen in on you for one. Second, it&#8217;s decentralized. Should AOL go belly up, we&#8217;d all be fairly screwed. With Jabber, a single service provider can go down or disappear and everyone else can keep jabbering.

Jabber also allows for chat gateways. For example, you can talk to MSN users through it. Melvin Rivera has written [an excellent tutorial](http://allforces.com/2005/05/06/ichat-to-msn-through-jabber/) to get this set up.

If you&#8217;re like me though, using a server in the Czech Republic isn&#8217;t settling. Besides, it&#8217;s a little hard to remember. You&#8217;ll be pleased to know that you can get an @godlikenerd.com username. All you have to do is contact me through the comments or the contact form.
