Over at [Mike&#8217;s blog](http://www.planetmike.com/blog/advertising/spam/gmail01.shtml), he&#8217;s redirecting all mail from a domain that gets over 3000 pieces of spam a day. I&#8217;m really looking forward to his results because he usually puts together pretty visual results that are fun to look at.

I&#8217;m still waiting for an objective comparison of the various spam filters out there, particularly the ones built into the big webmail services like Yahoo and Hotmail. I&#8217;ve found those services perform pretty terribly. Despite trying to &#8220;train&#8221; their filter, I regularly get mail with similar subjects dropped right into my inbox. I&#8217;ve heard Google&#8217;s is better, but I&#8217;d rather not pollute my own account for experimentation.
