Over at [Mike's blog](http://www.planetmike.com/blog/advertising/spam/gmail01.shtml), he's redirecting all mail from a domain that gets over 3000 pieces of spam a day. I'm really looking forward to his results because he usually puts together pretty visual results that are fun to look at.

I'm still waiting for an objective comparison of the various spam filters out there, particularly the ones built into the big webmail services like Yahoo and Hotmail. I've found those services perform pretty terribly. Despite trying to &#8220;train&#8221; their filter, I regularly get mail with similar subjects dropped right into my inbox. I've heard Google's is better, but I'd rather not pollute my own account for experimentation.
