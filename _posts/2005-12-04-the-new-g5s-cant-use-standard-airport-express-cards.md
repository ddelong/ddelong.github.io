> Maybe I'm just behind the times or didn't read the news stories about the dual core G5s intently enough. Apple is using combination Airport Express/Bluetooth 2.0 cards in G5s now instead of the Airport Express cards used in all other Macs.
> 
> From the [Apple KB](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=302721):
> 
> Power Mac G5 (Late 2005) computers are designed to work with a combination AirPort Extreme with Bluetooth 2.0+EDR card, which combines AirPort and Bluetooth wireless technologies on one card. Please note that other versions of AirPort cards cannot be used with Power Mac G5 (Late 2005) computers. Although the connector on the computer's logic board will fit an AirPort Extreme card, it is meant for the AirPort Extreme with Bluetooth 2.0+EDR card only. Power Mac G5 (Late 2005) computers will not recognize an AirPort Extreme card if you attempt to install one.
> 
> The antennas in the Power Mac G5 (Late 2005) also differ from previous Power Mac G5 models, which had an external antenna that attached to the back of the computer. All Power Mac G5 (Late 2005) computers have internal wireless antennas that come preinstalled, regardless of whether or not the computer has an AirPort Extreme with Bluetooth 2.0+EDR card installed.
> 
> The AirPort Extreme with Bluetooth 2.0+EDR card is available either as a factory-installed option at the time you purchase your Power Mac G5 (Late 2005), or you can add wireless capability post purchase(1) by having an Apple Authorized Service Provider or a retail Apple Store install the AirPort Extreme with Bluetooth 2.0+EDR card for you. The AirPort Extreme with Bluetooth 2.0+EDR card is not a DIY (do-it-yourself) part.
> 
>   1. The AirPort Extreme with Bluetooth 2.0+EDR card is now available from service providers for installation.

While this is a good idea, especially considering Bluetooth post sale was a band-aid USB solution, it's made things more complicated for the consumer, which isn't positive in the short term.
