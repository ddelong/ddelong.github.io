Being the vain man that I am, I [google myself](http://www.google.com/search?q=derik) every once in a while. I feel the compulsion, if for no other reason because I&#8217;m afraid of [Derik Farnsworth](http://www.derikfarnsworth.com) overtaking me, then coming to my house to call me a girly man.

Imagine my surprise when I found out that there was a story [about me as a camel](http://www.electricscotland.com/kids/stories/middleeast5.htm). I know everyone thinks of me as a camel because I have foul breath and spit a lot. Ha ha. Seriously though, the story is priceless as is the following repeated phrase.

> Derik, Derik, has no hump. Derik, Derik, what a chump!

It&#8217;s official. I have no hump and I am a chump.
