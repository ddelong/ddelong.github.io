I pulled the trigger on it. I added Google Ads to [Tag Central](http://tagcentral.net). I&#8217;ve also added a [shop section](/shop/) to this site. If you&#8217;re looking to buy something I&#8217;ve reviewed on the site or anything else from Amazon, please use that page. There is no cost difference to you and I get a percentage of the sale. It&#8217;s a great way for you to get some merchandise at a good price generally with free shipping and support the site.

Don&#8217;t worry. Putting ads here is not something I plan to do (at least for now). I reserve that right if times get tight, but I really don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be necessary. I&#8217;m definitely not putting ads into the feeds. That&#8217;s plain obnoxious. As for Tag Central, now that I&#8217;ve got it set up and running by itself, I need some other kind of motivation. I thought I&#8217;d try out financial.

As usual, let me know your thoughts.
