I pulled the trigger on it. I added Google Ads to [Tag Central](http://tagcentral.net). I've also added a [shop section](/shop/) to this site. If you're looking to buy something I've reviewed on the site or anything else from Amazon, please use that page. There is no cost difference to you and I get a percentage of the sale. It's a great way for you to get some merchandise at a good price generally with free shipping and support the site.

Don't worry. Putting ads here is not something I plan to do (at least for now). I reserve that right if times get tight, but I really don't think it'll be necessary. I'm definitely not putting ads into the feeds. That's plain obnoxious. As for Tag Central, now that I've got it set up and running by itself, I need some other kind of motivation. I thought I'd try out financial.

As usual, let me know your thoughts.
