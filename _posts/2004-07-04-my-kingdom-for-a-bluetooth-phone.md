I use [Verizon](http://www.verizonwireless.com) as my wireless provider. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s great. The service is consistent. My phone never cuts out on me (while half the people I know have such intermittent service that I end up calling their landline once they get home). It&#8217;s fairly cheap for me because I&#8217;m on a family plan (though that may change soon, but then I&#8217;ll have all those minutes to myself \*muahahahahaha\*).

However, I&#8217;m still using a [Nokia 5185i](http://www.nokiausa.com/phones/5185i) (shut up). By today&#8217;s standards, it&#8217;s big, heavy, lacks any good features (it doesn&#8217;t even vibrate). Basically, I&#8217;m chomping at the bit for a new phone. I love [SonyEricsson phones](http://www.sonyericsson.com) but none of them are available for Verizon.

Now that I have a computer with Bluetooth, I&#8217;m going to use it to the fullest. That means I want a fancy Bluetooth phone. I want to use my phone as a remote using [Sailing Clicker](http://homepage.mac.com/jonassalling/Shareware/Clicker/). I want to synchronize my phone book with iSync. However, Verizon doesn&#8217;t offer any Bluetooth phone.

It&#8217;s been so long since Bluetooth&#8217;s inception and there&#8217;s been so much demand that people have started [a petition](http://www.petitiononline.com/ver123/petition.html). At a recent conference, the Verizon CEO [joked about the lack of Bluetooth in their lineup](http://www.mobiletracker.net/archives/2004/06/08/verizon_wireles.php). Well, I (and other Verizon customers) aren&#8217;t laughing. It may be a big joke to him now, but when his customers start taking off for other carriers that are willing to seriously listen to their customers, it won&#8217;t be quite so funny.

The only saving grace is that there is speculation that [the Motorola V710](http://www.mobiletracker.net/archives/2004/02/13/fcc_approves_mo.php) will most likely be released soon as Verizon&#8217;s Bluetooth phone. If it is, I&#8217;ll probably buy it. However, if my contract with Verizon is up before they release it, I&#8217;ll be taking my business elsewhere.

Having a Bluetooth phone will not only be a great complement to my Powerbook (and Powermac when I get a Bluetooth adapter for it), but for the [Toyota Prius](http://www.toyota.com/prius/) I&#8217;m eyeing for my next car. Even if I don&#8217;t get the Prius, most cars (that I will be looking at) will have Bluetooth. Whether Verizon wants to come along is up to them.
