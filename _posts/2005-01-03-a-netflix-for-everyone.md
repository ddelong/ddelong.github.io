Little known fact about [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com), they have multiple plans (beyond their $17.99 3 at a time plan). In fact, they also have a 5-at-a-time for $29.99 and a 8-at-a-time for $47.99. Like the normal plan, that also includes unlimited rentals.

For the frugal user, they also have a 2-at-a-time plan. However, that comes with a caveat. You only get 4 movies a month total. However, at $11.99 it may still be worth it to some users.
