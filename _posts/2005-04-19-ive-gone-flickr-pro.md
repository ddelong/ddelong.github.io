I read a few blogs talking about [the recent Flickr bonuses](http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2005/04/new_prices_free.html) for their early Pro users. Current subscribers get two free years, their upload limit raised to 2 GB a month, and two free one year Pro subscriptions to give to friends.

Well, thanks to the fast friendship I&#8217;ve developed to Stuart over at [Blethers.com](http://blethers.com) and the fact that I saw [his post offering a membership](http://www.blethers.com/weblog/archives/001888.php) first, I&#8217;ll soon have a Pro membership over at [Flickr](http://flickr.com).

That means [my member page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/d00d/) over there will be updated all the time. I&#8217;ll probably start taking pictures every day just because I can upload them all and never think about it again.
