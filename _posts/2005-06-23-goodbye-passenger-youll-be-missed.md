Anyone that&#8217;s been a member of [Macworld&#8217;s forums](http://www.macworld.com/forums/) for a significant amount of time may remember the &#8220;Gabbery&#8221; forums. They were a haven of off-topic conversation with its own unique flavor. It ultimately had to come to an end. That story is for another time though.

One of the leading contributors was a member named Passenger. He was passionate and believed in what he said. That&#8217;s a rare trait now. When the &#8220;Gabbery&#8221; forums were disbanded, one of the members, [Kahloz](http://www.hurtingwang.com), started a new forum at his own website. Passenger made the migration with a few others. For months (or a year, I can&#8217;t remember), we talked about all topics, routinely getting on one another&#8217;s nerves.

There were times that I hated Passenger&#8217;s guts, but I always had to respect him. Eventually, the new community disbanded (history repeating I suspect) and most of us went our separate ways. Then the other day, Stryder, whom participated in the Kahloz forums, contacted me the other day. I was rather surprised as we never really personally spoke. It turned out that [Passenger had passed away](http://www.stryderc.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=3123) ([see also Kahloz&#8217;s entry](http://www.hurtingwang.com/upload/index.php?showtopic=45)).

Pass and I hadn&#8217;t debated in a very long time, but I&#8217;ll still miss the guy. I hope he finds peace wherever he is.
