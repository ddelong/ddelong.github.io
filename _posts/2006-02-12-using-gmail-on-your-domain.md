A little while back, Google announced it was [hosting San Jose City College's email](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/02/big-mail-on-campus.html). Prior to that, rumors started circulating that Google would be licensing its Gmail technology to others due to clues in the code.

Honestly, I could not see a downside to this arrangement ([paranoid delusions](http://www.gmail-is-too-creepy.com/) are not considered). Most college students don't want to fiddle with email client configuration. A webmail interface is perfect for campus wide availability. The over 2 gigabytes of storage space works great for students to send files back and forth on a regular basis. Because it's maintained by Google, it also means it'll be available to students even after they graduate. And yes, I am still a little bitter that U-Mass is too damn cheap to give lifetime email addresses to graduates.

Apparently, this arrangement is a beta test of sorts. Google followed that announcement up with a [small testing program for others to host the email for a domain](https://www.google.com/hosted/Home). Not only do they supply Gmail accounts, but they supply an administrative interface for the owner of that domain. That's pretty slick and considering the apparent price (free), a pretty good deal.

I'm going to try it out for the domain I set up for my family as ideally, I'd like them all using Gmail because otherwise, I have a feeling they'll constantly change email address as well as lose their emails. Should I get picked, I'll share my experiences, but I expect they'll be positive.
