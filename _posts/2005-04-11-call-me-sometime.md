So, I&#8217;ve heard lots and lots about [Skype](http://www.skype.com), the free Internet telephony service. Macworld [noticed it early on](http://www.macworld.com/2005/01/secrets/febworkingmac/index.php), but that wasn&#8217;t enough for me to perk up. I mean, with iChat AV (which is full video conferencing), why would I care?

I didn&#8217;t realize how cross-platform, flexible, and feature-filled it really is. Whether you use Windows, Linux, or a Mac, you can call your friends across town or the globe for free. Remember your hot French penpal that you got tired of writing to? Now you can talk <s>dirty</s> to them without thought of a huge phone bill. In fact, it&#8217;s so easy that even your tech stupid relatives can use the software.

Now, what if you want to call someone without an Internet connection or computer? You can buy for a modest fee phone time to any normal phone number. That&#8217;s cool, but what if they&#8217;re not around when you call? You can buy a phone number for your Skype account (a flat yearly fee). Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re not in. You can buy voicemail service from them.

Now I ask you, how cool is that? <!--more-->
