For some time now, I was using [Watson](http://www.karelia.com/watson/) to look through TV listings, look at show descriptions, change the channel on my [EyeTV](http://www.elgato.com), and schedule recordings.

Due to changes at [TVGuide.com](http://www.tvguide.com), [all those features have been lost](http://weblog.karelia.com/Watson/TV_Listings_updated.html). I originally bought Watson solely for those features. I&#8217;ll be surprised if the EyeTV support is kept for the product that is succeeding Watson due to its cross-platform and Java nature.

I know the changes to TVGuide.com are outside of Mr. Wood&#8217;s hands, but the sudden disappearance of the EyeTV features just smacks of the lack of support that I expected to come after he announced [the end of support in October](http://weblog.karelia.com/Watson/Future_Of_Watson.html).

I understand that transitioning to another source for TV listings is a lot of work, but I just expected support until October to be **full** support until October. I guess I&#8217;ll have to start using [TitanTV](http://www.titantv.com) and deal with their mess of a site.
