Most .Mac users may not have noticed, but mail aliases are available for use through .Mac&#8217;s webmail interface. You choose another email address (_yourchoice_@mac.com) and all mail to that address goes to your existing account.

The primary purpose for this feature is fairly obvious. It allows you to have &#8220;throw away&#8221; addresses to use in situations in which you don&#8217;t trust the entity you are giving your email to. If you begin to receive a lot of spam through that address, you simply disable it. Other services have had this for a while, but it&#8217;s a welcome addition to .Mac&#8217;s existing tools. .Mac&#8217;s web-mail also color codes incoming email according to the alias address they came in through (very nice). It&#8217;s finally being exposed by websites like [MacFixit](http://www.macfixit.com). I actually discovered this gem several weeks back and never thought to tell anyone about it. .Mac&#8217;s documentation actually makes no reference to it.

This is also a way for you to get an address you wish you had chosen when picking out your .Mac username (as long as another user hasn&#8217;t already chosen it). The less popular .Mac is, the more aliases are available for use, so personally I don&#8217;t care if other people don&#8217;t find it too expensive.

The only gripe I have left for .Mac (and the email component in particular) is the amount of space allotted. Given, 15 MB is plenty, but I&#8217;d like to have the capacity to continue to store all my mail on the server without periodically archiving old mail. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t complain if they bumped it to 100 or 50 MB.
