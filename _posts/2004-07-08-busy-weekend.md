I&#8217;ve successfully given myself too much to do this weekend.

I have to in no certain order: rotate my tires, change my oil, change the windshield wipers, go to Chestnut Hill to pick up some pants, and find a gym I like (as well as work out).

That may not sound like much, but getting father to do anything car related quickly is like wishing for the ability to fly, so I know I&#8217;m going to have to surrender the better part of 4 or 5 hours to the tire rotation alone. Add in the other couple tasks and there goes a whole day.

Traveling to Chestnut Hill will take a couple hours as well. I also have to hunt down the receipt for the pants so I can pick them up. They way mother puts things away, that alone could take a couple hours.

Also note the lack of anything fun in there. I haven&#8217;t even gotten to Friday and I&#8217;m already feeling like my weekend is over.

**Update:** I&#8217;ve now added seeing a Red Sox game on Friday night to my list of things to do. It&#8217;s something fun, but it&#8217;s killed any possibility of doing some of my errands on Friday. I&#8217;m just too popular.
