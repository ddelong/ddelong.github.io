_Verizon Wireless is now selling the Motorola V710 cell phone, for August availability, featuring Bluetooth and a megapixel camera. [[MacInTouch](http://www.macintouch.com/)]_

That's right boys and girls! Verizon is finally going to offer a Bluetooth phone. It looks like it will cost $250 (subtract $70 with a two year agreement).

I can't wait until it's released so that I can pump all that money into a new phone. My only problem is that due to its picture phone capability, I may not be able to bring it into work when I make the move to Woburn.

At any rate, this is good news for Verizon customers and hopefully will start the ball rolling with other manufacturers that make phones with CDMA compatibility.
