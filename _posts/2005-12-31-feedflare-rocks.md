[Heather](http://www.pixelscribbles.com/journal/) noticed that I turned on several of the [FeedFlare](http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/publishers/feedflare) features for my RSS feed. I fall in love with FeedBurner more and more every day.

I've turned them all on, save the Email Author feature, for obvious reasons. I may turn off the comment counter as I think it'll cause NetNewsWire to register a change, and therefore mark it as new again. All this for free! <!-- technorati tags start -->
