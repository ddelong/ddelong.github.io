I can&#8217;t quite explain how excited I am, but [Brent Simmons](http://www.inessential.com) likes [my NetNewsWire theme](http://godlikenerd.com/weblog/2004/10/09/my-netnewswire-style/) and will be including it with [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/). I&#8217;m quite thrilled and didn&#8217;t expect it to be worthy of that honor. At any rate, I&#8217;ll be referring to it as Autumn from now on.
