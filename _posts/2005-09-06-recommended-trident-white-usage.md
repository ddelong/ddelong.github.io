I couldn&#8217;t hold this one back. I picked up some [Trident](http://www.tridentgum.com) White gum at Walmart. &#8220;White&#8221; promises whiter teeth in as little as four weeks. Sounds easy enough. I chew gum and I&#8217;d like whiter teeth.

I decided to dig a little further and figure out exactly what was needed to get these results. It&#8217;s not written on the package, so I went to the [product&#8217;s web site](http://www.tridentgum.com/white_facts.html?content=2). There I found what I was looking for.

> Consumers may see results when they chew as little as 2 pieces for 20 minutes, 4 times per day for 4 weeks.

That&#8217;s a lot of numbers. I like numbers, so let&#8217;s figure out exactly what they mean. First, how many pieces of this gum will it take to see results?

**2** pieces/chewing * **4** chewings/day * **7** days/week * **4** weeks = **224 pieces**

That&#8217;s a lot of gum. How much of my time will it take to chew enough?

**4** chewings/day * **7** days/week * **4** weeks * **20** minutes/chewing = **2,240 minutes** or **37 hours and 20 minutes**

Good thing I can walk and chew gum at the same time. That&#8217;s almost a work week. How many packs of gum is that?

**224** pieces / **12** pieces/pack = **18.67 packs**

I think I&#8217;ll give up on the dream of whiter teeth now.
