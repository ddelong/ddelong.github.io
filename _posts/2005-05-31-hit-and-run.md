So my good friend Allison invited me to her house in Worcester for a cookout. Good times. I went home in a good mood.

The next morning, mother woke me up. _Did you get in an accident last night?_ she asked. Now, I didn&#8217;t remember an accident. I wasn&#8217;t that out of it. It made me wake with a start though.

It turns out that while I was parked on that side street in Worcester, someone managed to hit my car. This is the 4th time it&#8217;s been hit while it was stationary. Line right up ladies and gentlemen. See the car that only gets dented when not in motion.

This means that I won&#8217;t be able to go anywhere while it&#8217;s in the shop. No softball games. That&#8217;s depressing. It also means that I&#8217;m likely to spend my $500 deductible because some jackass in a stupid SUV couldn&#8217;t judge the size of his vehicle.
