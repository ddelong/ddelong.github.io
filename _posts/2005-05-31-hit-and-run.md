So my good friend Allison invited me to her house in Worcester for a cookout. Good times. I went home in a good mood.

The next morning, mother woke me up. _Did you get in an accident last night?_ she asked. Now, I didn't remember an accident. I wasn't that out of it. It made me wake with a start though.

It turns out that while I was parked on that side street in Worcester, someone managed to hit my car. This is the 4th time it's been hit while it was stationary. Line right up ladies and gentlemen. See the car that only gets dented when not in motion.

This means that I won't be able to go anywhere while it's in the shop. No softball games. That's depressing. It also means that I'm likely to spend my $500 deductible because some jackass in a stupid SUV couldn't judge the size of his vehicle.
