I recently added a [43 Places page](http://godlikenerd.com/activity/43places/) to the site. 43 Places is yet another website that's under the [Robot Co-op](http://robotcoop.com) umbrella. You can track where you've been and where you want to be, something that many people were doing with [43 Things](http://www.things.com).

However, as it wasn't designed for destinations, lots of duplicate goals were registered at 43 Things. For example, you might have &#8220;See Germany&#8221;, &#8220;Visit Germany&#8221;, &#8220;Go to Germany&#8221;, and so on. 43 Places is much more exact and allows for places within other places be entered that way (such as having Fenway Park in Boston).

There are a few flaws with the current system. [Aruba](http://www.43places.com/places/view/200314) is in Venezuela according to the site. On the whole, it's well done and definitely a good time waster.
