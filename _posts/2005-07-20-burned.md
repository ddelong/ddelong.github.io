Some time ago, I used [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com) to make a new feed for the site. I called it the [Superfeed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/godlikenerd) and used their service to add in [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) photos and [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) bookmarks. However, I found it way too limiting. There were other sources I wanted to add, such as my Netflix notifications and my [Ta-da List](http://www.tadalist.com). While I used it though, I became addicted to their statistics. I could instantly gauge how many people were reading.

The problem was that many people probably weren&#8217;t using the Superfeed. I used the stock RSS feed as the official one for a long time and despite making the Superfeed the default (and then switching in [another Feedburner feed that was just the blog](http://feeds.feedburner.com/d00dism)), I imagine many were still using the old feed (meaning my count was wildly inaccurate). To make matters worse [Safari would choose the Atom feed no matter what](http://godlikenerd.com/weblog/2005/05/19/safari-rss-autodiscovery-sucks/). I started to cobble a solution together by adding an Atom version of the feed. That wasn&#8217;t a complete solution.

I was so relieved to discover [a WordPress plugin](http://orderedlist.com/articles/wordpress-feedburner-plugin/) that would redirect all feeds to your Feedburner feed. It required a little tweaking (there&#8217;s a bug if the WordPress installation is in another location), but it seems to have successfully redirected most everyone. I&#8217;m not sure about [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) as it still says I&#8217;m using the old feed (which suggests that Bloglines doesn&#8217;t obey 302 permanent redirects correctly; I guess you can&#8217;t win them all). Anyway, today&#8217;s count is up around 40, a pretty respectable number in my book. I may have to put one of those little chiclets on the main page to brag.
