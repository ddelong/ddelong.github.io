Fire up your TiVo (or EyeTV in my case). [Monk](http://www.usanetwork.com/series/monk/) is back. I love the show, but not the way in which they've been jerking me around. First it was just on USA. Then it was on ABC. Then back to USA. They changed the time around a couple times.

They had finally settled on 10 PM on Fridays. Then of course that had to be upset by putting Kojak on at that time instead (I wanted to like that show too, but I just couldn't bring myself to). I was afraid that the replacement of Monk's nurse had been the death knell for the show. It wasn't.

Here's the teaser for the upcoming season:

> SEASON 4 IS COMING! When a fellow detective shows up at a crime scene knowing all the answers, has Monk finally met his match&#8230; or is the other detective cheating? Don't miss guest star Jason Alexander in the Monk season premiere, &#8220;Mr. Monk and the Other Detective,&#8221; premiering Friday, July 8th at 10/9C. And coming up later this season: Monk gets closer to his new assistant Natalie (Traylor Howard) as she becomes quite a crime solver herself; John Turturro returns in his Emmy&reg;-winning role as Monk's agoraphobic brother, Ambrose; Monk's beloved murdered wife Trudy (Melora Hardin) appears to return from the dead; and you'll meet Monk as a teenager and discover the true beginnings of how he became the Monk you've come to know and love. Tune in to USA Network on Friday nights at 10/9C for all new episodes of Monk all summer long!
