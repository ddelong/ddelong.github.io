I've been using MovableType to run my blog here and it's been working great.

However, MovableType 3.0 and up are no longer free. For now, the current version of MovableType I'm using is sufficient, but I'm concerned about long term viability.

The guys over at [Unsanity](http://www.unsanity.org/2004/07/29/moved-to-wordpress/) have moved to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), which seems pretty nice as well.

Does anyone have any recommendations for Blogging choices? Keep in mind, I'd like to continue to have the option to publish using [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/), which does limit the options a bit (WordPress may be out of the running because of this). My host does supply Blogger software as part of their package as well.
