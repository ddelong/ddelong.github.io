You&#8217;re all very tired of hearing about my latest purchase. Well, I have a nice L.L. Bean briefcase-like laptop bag that I&#8217;ve been using for about 4 years now. It&#8217;s a great bag. It served me well all through college. What made it even better was that it&#8217;s computer compartment fit my old Powerbook (the Pismo) perfectly. It was tight and snug in its padded compartment. It even had it&#8217;s own sleeve type thing that fit it.

Well, now I have a problem. The new Powerbook is much smaller. It flops around even in the sleeve thing that came with the bag. Being overly careful with my electronics, and this purchase in particular, I want to make sure it doesn&#8217;t flop around and possibly get scratched or damaged (not that I think it&#8217;s that sensitive).

There are lots of options, almost too many to count. I&#8217;m narrowing in on a sleeve from [Waterfield Bags](http://www.sfbags.com), as I&#8217;ve heard good things.

Again, comments, suggestions are always welcome.
