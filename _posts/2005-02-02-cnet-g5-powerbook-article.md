I thought I&#8217;d link [the CNET article on G5 Powerbooks](http://news.com.com/Apple+on+G5+PowerBook+Not+so+fast/2100-1044_3-5559311.html) as David Becker was kind enough to email me and ask my opinions. Unfortunately, it seems that they couldn&#8217;t use any of my ramblings, but I thought it might be of interest to publish what I wrote, considering my rather short, lackluster writeup on the new Powerbooks.

David sent me the below email with questions.

> Hi&#8211;my name is Dave Becker, and I&#8217;m a reporter for CNET News.com. Saw your bloggings on matters Mac and hoped you might be willing to offer your comments on possible/planned G5 PowerBooks.
> 
> &#8212; How hungry is the Mac community for these? Do want one yourself?
> 
> &#8212; What if it meant having to design somethiong that departed from Apple&#8217;s slim and quiet aesthetic?
> 
> &#8212; What would be the advatages of a G5 PowerBook over a G4 running at similar speed?
> 
> Thanks for your help, David Becker, staff writer CNET News.com

I responded with:

I&#8217;d be more than willing. Thanks for asking. I&#8217;ll answer the questions in turn.

Large portions of the Mac community are very interested. In particular, the more vocal parts that participate in forums. However, I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s entirely representative of the Mac community at large. I&#8217;m inclined to think that even some of the newer users recognize the general emphasis placed upon the generation number of the processor. A G5 inherently sounds more powerful than a G4, and it is.
  
However, whether the same users that cry out for G5 speed need or can even really utilize is a question I&#8217;ve yet to be seen answered definitively. I&#8217;ll speak more to that later. As for myself, it&#8217;s tempting. I know I don&#8217;t need one, but having a Powerbook G5 is just so damn cool. It&#8217;s bragging rights and a status symbol. However, I just got a new 12&#8243; Powerbook last summer (though outdated by today&#8217;s announcement) which more than satisfies my needs. I&#8217;ve also got a Powermac G4 sitting upstairs that also has plenty of life in it. I can&#8217;t justify spending the money just yet. Then again, if you guys at CNet feel like sending me one, I won&#8217;t refuse it. ðŸ˜‰

The question of aesthetics is astute. Apple (at least under Steve Jobs) makes looks and feel a top priority. Would the original iMac or the iMac G4 have been such hot sellers without looking so good? I doubt it. The drastic difference in sales and the state of Apple pre and post iMac is proof positive. However, I don&#8217;t doubt that Apple will find a way to integrate both the beautiful and powerful. I think the real question is whether the whole Powerbook line will go G5 all at once. The extra space afforded by a 17&#8243; or 15&#8243; case facilitates better thermal management than could be possible in a 12&#8243; case. We may see a period where just the 17&#8243; or the 17&#8243; and 15&#8243; are G5s while the Powerbook 12&#8243; is marketed as an ultra-portable with extended battery life as it will inevitably consume far less energy than even a low power G5.

The first and foremost advantage of a G5 Powerbook is marketability. One can imagine the commercials already. &#8220;The power of supercomputer in your bag.&#8221; The supercomputer reference would naturally be to the Virginia Tech G5 cluster System X. The actual technical advantages would primarily be growth potential and bus speed. A half speed or even third speed bus would be easily three times as fast as the current bus. However, the utility of this is unclear in the context of a portable. The real advantage of having such a powerful bus is being able to manipulate many high speed devices. In order to force that situation with a Powerbook, it would essentially need to be chained to a desk negating portability. This might be of real interest of those that don&#8217;t do the majority of their work on the road, but only occasionally do so and primarily use their laptop as a desktop replacement. If that&#8217;s the market segment they go after, then they may be able to get away with a less aesthetic, larger, more utilitarian portable. It could be a whole new line, named something like the Xbook or similar. I&#8217;m not sure about any other advantages as the main limiting factor for Powerbooks as I see it are the video cards. The just don&#8217;t measure up to desktop video cards and that will prevent the Powerbooks from being as powerful as many Powerbook G5 proponents want.

I hope some of what I&#8217;ve said is useful. Please write back if need any clarification. I look forward to anything you might write using any of this. Please send me the link if you do. Thanks for the opportunity.
