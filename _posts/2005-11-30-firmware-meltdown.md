So, the WRT54GC router arrived on Monday. Seeing as it was my birthday, it was like a gift to myself. I immediately started playing with it, turning on WPA2 and putting in a password from Steve Gibson&#8217;s excellent [WPA password generator](https://grc.com/pass).

Being the obsessive compulsive software upgrader that I am, I decided to flash its firmware. Keep in mind that I&#8217;ve flashed many network devices including an original Airport Base Station, a Linksys BEFSR41, a D-Link DI 624, a D-Link DI-524, a Motorola WA840G, a D-Link DWL-G810, and a couple other routers. I can&#8217;t list the others because usually I was upgrading the firmware of some stranger&#8217;s unprotected router over the wireless connection. Yes, I am a daredevil.

All that said, when I attempted this (totally routine and over a wired connection) upgrade, it failed. I&#8217;m not talking about simply needing to retry it or having to reset the router and try again. I&#8217;m talking about an amber powerlight complete meltdown. I got walked through the reset procedure by two separate Linksys tech support people (even though I&#8217;d already done it). Finally, they told me to return it to Amazon for a replacement.

When the new one arrives, I&#8217;m going to try it again even though it&#8217;s tempting fate. If it fails again, I&#8217;m going to be a little suspicious.
