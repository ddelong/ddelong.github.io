Because nearly every business gives Veteran's Day off (save for Raytheon obviously), my entire commute took only 40 minutes, as compared with the normal hour and ten minutes to two hours. People left space, one could change lanes to pass someone if they wished, and I didn't have the urge to jump out of my car and clobber anyone.

_Amazing._

I know my ride home will be nice and I'm just glad that I'm not working tomorrow because I couldn't take dealing with the normal traffic again so soon after my best ride in to Woburn ever.
