So I&#8217;m currently 4 out of 5 and Henry forgot to pick confidence so he didn&#8217;t get any points (Henry, if you&#8217;re reading this, fix it before this weekend).

  1. smudie (**101**)
  2. Katie (**89**)
  3. Mike (**85**)
  4. Me (**81**)
  5. Henry (**** explained above)

It&#8217;s a little embarressing. For a scot living in France, Stuart knows his football. In fact, he did better than anyone in my work football group.

Here&#8217;s my picks ordered from least confidence to most. Real winners are bold. Bold are picks that I had right. Italics are ones that I was wrong.

  1. **Detroit** vs. Green Bay
  2. _San Diego_ vs. Dallas
  3. New York Giants vs. _Arizona_
  4. **Kansas City** vs. New York Jets
  5. **Jacksonville** vs. Seattle
  6. Denver vs. **Miami**
  7. Buffalo vs. _Houston_
  8. **Washington** vs. Chicago
  9. _Minnesota_ vs. Tamba Bay
 10. _St. Louis_ vs. San Fransisco
 11. _Philadelphia_ vs. Atlanta
 12. **Indianapolis** vs. Batlimore
 13. _Carolina_ vs. New Orleans
 14. **Cincinnatti** vs. Cleveland
 15. **Pittsburgh** vs. Tennessee
 16. **New England** vs. Oakland

What&#8217;s interesting is that no one, save Stuart, thought New Orleans would win, not even Henry. That was a real coup. Other notable upsets were San Fransisco, Dallas, and Atlanta. As much as I hate St. Louis, I&#8217;m still surprised they lost to San Fransisco.

Everyone thought Minnesota was going to win over Tampa Bay, but it&#8217;s looking like they&#8217;ll be the big losers this year without Moss.

Having seen all the teams play, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if everyone&#8217;s accurary improves or gets worse, particularly Stuart.
