So I'm currently 4 out of 5 and Henry forgot to pick confidence so he didn't get any points (Henry, if you're reading this, fix it before this weekend).

  1. smudie (**101**)
  2. Katie (**89**)
  3. Mike (**85**)
  4. Me (**81**)
  5. Henry (**** explained above)

It's a little embarressing. For a scot living in France, Stuart knows his football. In fact, he did better than anyone in my work football group.

Here's my picks ordered from least confidence to most. Real winners are bold. Bold are picks that I had right. Italics are ones that I was wrong.

  1. **Detroit** vs. Green Bay
  2. _San Diego_ vs. Dallas
  3. New York Giants vs. _Arizona_
  4. **Kansas City** vs. New York Jets
  5. **Jacksonville** vs. Seattle
  6. Denver vs. **Miami**
  7. Buffalo vs. _Houston_
  8. **Washington** vs. Chicago
  9. _Minnesota_ vs. Tamba Bay
 10. _St. Louis_ vs. San Fransisco
 11. _Philadelphia_ vs. Atlanta
 12. **Indianapolis** vs. Batlimore
 13. _Carolina_ vs. New Orleans
 14. **Cincinnatti** vs. Cleveland
 15. **Pittsburgh** vs. Tennessee
 16. **New England** vs. Oakland

What's interesting is that no one, save Stuart, thought New Orleans would win, not even Henry. That was a real coup. Other notable upsets were San Fransisco, Dallas, and Atlanta. As much as I hate St. Louis, I'm still surprised they lost to San Fransisco.

Everyone thought Minnesota was going to win over Tampa Bay, but it's looking like they'll be the big losers this year without Moss.

Having seen all the teams play, it'll be interesting to see if everyone's accurary improves or gets worse, particularly Stuart.
