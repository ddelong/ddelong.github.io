I haven&#8217;t posted in a while due partially to getting a cat (pictures will follow&#8230; someday). As I went to go to take pictures, I realized both my batteries were dead. Charging them takes a while, so I sat down to finally label and describe all the photos I took when I moved into my house, all 82 of them. Now you know why it took me a couple months to get around to it.

I haven&#8217;t fully tagged it, but it&#8217;s certainly viewable [over on Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/d00d/sets/1201461/). Now you can see where the _magic_ happens. While I was logged in, I noticed that Jason put up [some cool football pictures](http://flickr.com/photos/jsnell/sets/1196993/) which are worth a look if you&#8217;re a football or Cal/WSU fan.
