For some time now, I&#8217;ve been using MarsEdit to post to my weblog. It&#8217;s the standalone version of the blog editing capabilities that were part of NetNewsWire (Pro). I didn&#8217;t get to talk about this because it was private. With the now public beta releases I am freed of that obligation.

You can see more information on [Brent Simmon&#8217;s Blog](http://www.inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2901) (which should be part of your RSS subscriptions by now). Simply said, it&#8217;s pure perfection. You can use it with any of a number of blogging software packages. This includes:

  * Blogger
  * Blogware
  * Blosxom
  * Conversant
  * Drupal
  * LiveJournal
  * Manila (News Items)
  * Moveable Type
  * PHPosxom
  * pMachine
  * Radio UserLand
  * SnipSnap
  * TypePad
  * **WordPress**
  * Other Blogger-compatible systems
  * Other Blosxom-compatible systems
  * Other MetaWeblog-compatible systems

My emphasis was added because obviously, WordPress is what I use. Until I got a crack at MarsEdit, I had to use one the _other_ types. There&#8217;s nothing necessarily all that wrong with that, but the behavior isn&#8217;t quite what you&#8217;d expect and you had to be a little more adept to set it up.

Drupal is also the system being used by [Spreadfirefox.com](http://spreadfirefox.com) which means yet another free place to set up your weblog.

At any rate, check out NetNewsWire 2.0 beta and MarsEdit beta. You may just buy a license. Imagine that. If you&#8217;re really cheap and don&#8217;t need a weblog editor, check out NetNewsWire Lite, perhaps the best free RSS reader on any platform.
