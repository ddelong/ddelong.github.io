Back when the Supreme Court handed down their decision on Grokster, I made [a few quick conclusions](http://godlikenerd.com/weblog/2005/06/27/grokster-loses/) based upon some cursory reading I did. I didn't really expect to [get quoted on Computerworld](http://www.computerworld.com/blogs/node/464).
