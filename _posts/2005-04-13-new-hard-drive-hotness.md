Tiger being released on April 29th was enough incentive for me to rationalize buying a fancy new Serial ATA hard drive. For a while now, I&#8217;d been eyeing the [Western Digital Raptor](http://www.wdc.com/en/products/Products.asp?DriveID=65&Language=en), which is still the fastest SATA hard drive you can buy. However, it&#8217;s only 74 GB big and costs [$185](http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=101222) (lowest price I could find).

Then I saw a [Barefeats article](http://www.barefeats.com/boot02.html) comparing the Raptor to a [Maxtor DiamondMax 10](http://www.maxtor.com/portal/site/Maxtor/menuitem.ba88f6d7cf664718376049b291346068/?channelpath=/en_us/Products/ATA%20Hard%20Drives/Desktop/DiamondMax%2010). The question was which was the ultimate G5 boot drive. Well, I don&#8217;t have a G5, but I figure the question is just as valid for a G4 (and I&#8217;ll be moving to a G5 eventually). The verdict was that the Maxtor drive was the better drive because the performance was comparable, it was much larger (300 GB), and a little cheaper ([$180](http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=100719) at [ZipZoomFly](http://www.zipzoomfly.com)).

To be able to attach an SATA drive to my G4, I also ordered a [Firmtek Seritek PCI SATA card](http://www.firmtek.com/seritek/seritek-1s2/) from [Other World Computing](http://www.macsales.com). Luckily, I quickly realized I&#8217;d need a [power adapter cable]() and ordered that as well. Thanks to ZipZoomFly having free 2-day shipping and Other World Computing having a 2-day shipping for $5, I should have the whole kit &#8216;n caboodle on Friday. I&#8217;ll try some [Xbench](http://www.xbench.com/) tests to compare my stock hard drive and external firewire drive to it.

I&#8217;ll keep the drive virginal for the Tiger installation. Once that&#8217;s installed, I&#8217;ll share experiences about the boot delay (due to booting from a PCI card). That week I also plan on talking about each feature and my thoughts on it. I&#8217;ll even do some screenshots (I should have switched webhosts by then).
