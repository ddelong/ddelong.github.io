The _infamous_ company MacMice has announced [a new product](http://www.dvforge.com/theball.shtml) called &#8220;The Ball&#8221;. I&#8217;ll admit, it sounds a little dirty to me (and would probably illicit a snicker or two from less mature audiences).

It follows its brother product, &#8220;The Mouse&#8221;, not in nomenclature, but in appearance. It&#8217;ll fit in with your other Mac peripherals. What makes this trackball cool though is the fact that it&#8217;s Bluetooth. In fact, it&#8217;s the first Bluetooth trackball I&#8217;ve ever seen. That alone makes it pretty cool. However, I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s $90 worth of cool. I never really understood the practicality of wireless trackballs either, so this isn&#8217;t something I&#8217;m likely to get.
