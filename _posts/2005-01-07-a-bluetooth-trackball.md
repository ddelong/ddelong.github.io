The _infamous_ company MacMice has announced [a new product](http://www.dvforge.com/theball.shtml) called &#8220;The Ball&#8221;. I'll admit, it sounds a little dirty to me (and would probably illicit a snicker or two from less mature audiences).

It follows its brother product, &#8220;The Mouse&#8221;, not in nomenclature, but in appearance. It'll fit in with your other Mac peripherals. What makes this trackball cool though is the fact that it's Bluetooth. In fact, it's the first Bluetooth trackball I've ever seen. That alone makes it pretty cool. However, I'm not sure that it's $90 worth of cool. I never really understood the practicality of wireless trackballs either, so this isn't something I'm likely to get.
