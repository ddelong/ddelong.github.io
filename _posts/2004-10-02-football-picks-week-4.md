It&#8217;s week four of the football season and the Patriots are back from their bye-week. Here are my predictions:

  * **New England** vs. Buffalo
  * **Philadelphia** vs. Chicago
  * Washington vs. **Cleveland**
  * NY Giants vs. **Green Bay**
  * **Oakland** vs. Houston
  * **Indianapolis** vs. Jacksonville
  * Cincinnati vs. **Pittsburgh**
  * **New Orleans** vs. Arizona
  * Atlanta vs. **Carolina**
  * **NY Jets** vs. Miami
  * **Tennessee** vs. San Diego
  * **Denver** vs. Tampa Bay
  * **St. Louis** vs. San Fransisco
  * **Kansis City** vs. Baltimore

So far, my record is 11-3.
