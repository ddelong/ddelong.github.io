Found via [Slashdot](http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/01/0421248&from=rss), Apple is using DRM to keep parts of the OS from working on unauthorized computers. The Slashdot story includes links to [a wiki on x86 Mac OS X](http://www.osx86.classicbeta.com/wiki/index.php/TPM), which in turn pulls its information about the TCPA/TPM DRM from [this FAQ](http://www.againsttcpa.com/tcpa-faq-en.html).

The problem is that the site is titled **Against TCPA** (which is also their domain name). It's not exactly an unbiased source, to say the least. I want to find a slightly less paranoid breakdown of the technology.

That said, this may very well be the way that Apple wants to use to prohibit use of Mac OS X on generic Intel PCs. The question then becomes is this DRM in some way hackable? If so, we'll likely see OS X on generic Intel PCs. If not, we won't.
