Lately Google has been really generous with invitations to their free email service. I keep getting back up to maximum six invites, almost as fast as I can give them out. If you are interested, leave a comment.

Please make some kind of case for it if I don't already know you. Saying &#8220;Please stranger, I really want one&#8221; is not a way to endear yourself to me.
