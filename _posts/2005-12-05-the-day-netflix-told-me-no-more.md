It&#8217;s official. I have way too many movies in my queue. I tried to add [Suspiria](http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=60037424&trkid=181036) to my Netflix queue, only to get the following response.

> If you wish to add this movie to your Queue, you must first remove some movies.

I&#8217;m going to trim it a little, but I fear I may be forced to spawn a new queue (just for TV shows). Boo to Netflix for its artificial 500 movie queue limit. Split it into multiple pages if necessary. I don&#8217;t care how they handle it. It&#8217;s an inconvenience to me.
