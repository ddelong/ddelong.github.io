I wanted to add some neat appearance effects to [my resume&#8217;s page](/resume) without having to make images and use tables, etc. Instead, I thought I&#8217;d try my hand at CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as it seemed to do a good job with both this blog and [the FAQ](/osxforumfaq).

It turns out CSS is a lot easier than I&#8217;d originally thought. Using objects and inheritance to propagate style changes, it&#8217;s a natural language (and I use that term loosely in this case) to pick up for an OO programmer.

You&#8217;ve probably noticed I&#8217;ve changed the color scheme for the blog itself. It was child&#8217;s play, especially using [BBEdit](http://www.bbedit.com), which gives access to pretty much anything in CSS very easily. Consider it a work in progress as I&#8217;m not exactly the best at picking color schemes.

I also need to make a logo, but, again, I&#8217;m not terribly artistic. If any more graphically inclined people read this, feel free to comment if you&#8217;d like to help out.
