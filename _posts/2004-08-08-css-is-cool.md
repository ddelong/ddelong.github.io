I wanted to add some neat appearance effects to [my resume's page](/resume) without having to make images and use tables, etc. Instead, I thought I'd try my hand at CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as it seemed to do a good job with both this blog and [the FAQ](/osxforumfaq).

It turns out CSS is a lot easier than I'd originally thought. Using objects and inheritance to propagate style changes, it's a natural language (and I use that term loosely in this case) to pick up for an OO programmer.

You've probably noticed I've changed the color scheme for the blog itself. It was child's play, especially using [BBEdit](http://www.bbedit.com), which gives access to pretty much anything in CSS very easily. Consider it a work in progress as I'm not exactly the best at picking color schemes.

I also need to make a logo, but, again, I'm not terribly artistic. If any more graphically inclined people read this, feel free to comment if you'd like to help out.
