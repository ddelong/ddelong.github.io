I&#8217;ve gotten into a habit of periodically reducing the number of emails I keep on the server with my IMAP addresses because, unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have a huge amount of space with them.

This is a relatively simple task. You create a local email folder (in the &#8220;On My Mac&#8221; section) and drag all your messages there. This will create a .mbox file (a very standard format) in ~/Library/Mail/Mailboxes.

Take those files and back them up to a stable medium like CDs and you&#8217;re done. It&#8217;s quick and easy. Entourage does have the advantage of allowing you to drag straight from its windows to somewhere in the Finder, but I find this one extra step insignificant.
