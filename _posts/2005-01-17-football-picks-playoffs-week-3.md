Seeing as there are only two games next week, I think I can pick them now.

  * **New England** vs. Pittsburgh
  * **Atlanta** vs. Philadelphia

Atlanta looked really strong and I think their run game may destroy the Eagles. Pittsburgh simply didn&#8217;t look that good against the Jets (who would have won save for two missed kicks).
