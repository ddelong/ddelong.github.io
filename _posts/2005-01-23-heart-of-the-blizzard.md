I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve all been waiting for an update from yours truly to make sure I survived the blizzard. I have.

I spent a good portion of the day cleaning several feet of snow off our deck. Sounds easy enough, but it&#8217;s far more involved than it seems. First, I had to use the regular scoop shovel to make a little path and level the snow down enough to use the wide push shovel. Then as mother was using that, I had to try to level down the rest of the deck. After a couple hours of that, the deck is almost finished.

On to the car and an almost equal ordeal (stupid 2 car garage and having no space for my car). At least it gave me motivation to put the new registration sticker on my license plate.

Then of course it&#8217;s time to rake snow off the roof right back onto the deck. Argh. Pete and Repeat were on a boat. Pete fell off. Who&#8217;s left?

Good news is that I got to have some soup for lunch and dinner is my absolute favorite, Split Pea Soup. Yeah, I like soup. Chowder too. Anything wet actually.

So I&#8217;m alive. And Jeremy, if you&#8217;re reading this, I can&#8217;t imagine how jealous you are.
