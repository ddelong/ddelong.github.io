I'm sure you've all been waiting for an update from yours truly to make sure I survived the blizzard. I have.

I spent a good portion of the day cleaning several feet of snow off our deck. Sounds easy enough, but it's far more involved than it seems. First, I had to use the regular scoop shovel to make a little path and level the snow down enough to use the wide push shovel. Then as mother was using that, I had to try to level down the rest of the deck. After a couple hours of that, the deck is almost finished.

On to the car and an almost equal ordeal (stupid 2 car garage and having no space for my car). At least it gave me motivation to put the new registration sticker on my license plate.

Then of course it's time to rake snow off the roof right back onto the deck. Argh. Pete and Repeat were on a boat. Pete fell off. Who's left?

Good news is that I got to have some soup for lunch and dinner is my absolute favorite, Split Pea Soup. Yeah, I like soup. Chowder too. Anything wet actually.

So I'm alive. And Jeremy, if you're reading this, I can't imagine how jealous you are.
