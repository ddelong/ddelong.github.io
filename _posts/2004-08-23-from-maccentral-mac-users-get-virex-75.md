> [.Mac users get Virex 7.5](http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2004/08/23/virex/?lsrc=mcrss-0804): &#8220;Following McAfee Inc.'s [July announcement](http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2004/07/19/virex/) that its Macintosh anti-virus software utility Virex would be updated to version 7.5 and released in August, the new version of the software is now available for download for subscribers of Apple's [.Mac](http://www.mac.com) online service. .Mac has offered previous versions of Virex as part of its basic service. Virex 7.5 incorporates new features including a background scanner, an &#8220;active&#8221; scanner that maintains connections to the local network and the Internet, new tracking and reporting capabilities, a schedule editor that lets you automate scans and updates and more.&#8221;
(Via [MacCentral](http://maccentral.macworld.com/).)

Parity has once again been restored between the .Mac and the retail version of Virex. .Mac subscribers, pick up your copy, even if you're not going to use it. You never know when you might need it.
