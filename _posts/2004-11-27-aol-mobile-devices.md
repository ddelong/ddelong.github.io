I've had it with AOL's mobile device feature. I come online and I don't inspect all my buddies to see if they are regular AOL or mobile. Certain users are always forwarding their IMs. I send a message expecting to get back a meaningful message and instead I'm greeted with the standard forwarding response.

Now, that wouldn't be so bad if I then got back an IM from them while they were on their phone, but most often I get nothing. What's the point? Is having a phone number not enough? Maybe I'm just getting old.
