I&#8217;ve had it with AOL&#8217;s mobile device feature. I come online and I don&#8217;t inspect all my buddies to see if they are regular AOL or mobile. Certain users are always forwarding their IMs. I send a message expecting to get back a meaningful message and instead I&#8217;m greeted with the standard forwarding response.

Now, that wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if I then got back an IM from them while they were on their phone, but most often I get nothing. What&#8217;s the point? Is having a phone number not enough? Maybe I&#8217;m just getting old.
