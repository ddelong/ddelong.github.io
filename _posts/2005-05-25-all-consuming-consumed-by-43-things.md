One of the neatest things I've found lately is the proliferation of websites to manage aspects of your life publicly. Seeing as I'm not totally privacy paranoid, it's a fun hobby. I recently discovered [All Consuming](http://www.allconsuming.net) which was created by [Erik Benson](http://www.erikbenson.com). It's a neat way to track books, music, and movies that you're reading, listening to, and watching respectively.

[Robot Co-op](http://www.robotcoop.com), the company that runs [43 Things](http://43things.com), [bought it up](http://robotcoop.com/weblog/72/). This means that the two services will soon be intertwined. 43 Things is one of the sources on [Tag Central](http://tagcentral.net) but unfortunately All Consuming is not because they don't supply RSS feed for their tags. Hopefully that will change.

Erik also does a very neat thing with his site. He collects all his data from many sites into a single place using [Bloglines](http://bloglines.com). It's ultra-slick. I almost do this with [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com), collecting my Flickr and Del.icio.us data into the feed. However, at press time, they still don't allow addition of arbitrary RSS feeds, which is really disappointing. I think I'll start an aggregation a la Erik's site sometime soon so I don't feel pressed to publish all the time. I'll keep you updated.
