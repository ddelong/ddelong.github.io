I recently added a link into the supplement about [AOL giving free email to AIM users](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AOL_FREE_E_MAIL?SITE=APWEB&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT). I saw Slashdot cover the same story and one comment gave information about how to access it. Naturally I had to try it out for myself.

Now, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com) has the ultimate interface (I still have plenty of invites if you want one). So honestly, my expectations for AOL&#8217;s new mail service weren&#8217;t that great. However, the question is if it&#8217;s better or worse than the other webmail providers, such as [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com) or [HoTMaiL](http://www.hotmail.com).

From my preliminary testing, I think AOL has done a decent job with its interface. My preference for webmail services now ranks as Gmail, AIM Mail, Yahoo! Mail, and then HoTMaiL. Now, I&#8217;m definitely not trying to bash Microsoft for no reason. Let&#8217;s be honest. HoTMaiL sucks. Its interface is complex and yet, has less functionality than any other provider.

I&#8217;ll start by telling you how you can try this out for yourself because most everyone I know already has an AIM screenname. Go to <http://mail.aol.com> and type in your username and password. That brings you to the main mail screen. Your email address will be _screenname_@aim.com (not aol.com, that&#8217;s important).

It&#8217;s nice and clean. Now, the most complicated part of a web interface (and the one you&#8217;re most likely to work the most in) is the sending part. AOL covers all the important parts well. It will auto-complete addresses you&#8217;ve sent to before or are in your address book, warn of spelling errors (without having to load a series of pages), and will confirm the send.

Receiving the message in Mail.app immediately revealed a bad element to the new service. Like Yahoo, AOL stamps all messages you send out with a plug at the bottom of the email. The message as I received it with the test message was:

> Check out AIM Mail &#8211; Now you can also use your AIM Screen Name as your aim.com email address.

[![Received Message](http://photos13.flickr.com/13898160_836ebde4e8_t.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/19959606@N00/13898160 "Received Message")

This drives me insane as a receiver. I don&#8217;t want to see that because I shouldn&#8217;t be paying for the sender&#8217;s use of the service by looking at advertising. As a sender I don&#8217;t like it because I&#8217;m not told about this and it also means that they are doctoring my email messages. Given it&#8217;s just a footer, but I don&#8217;t like it.

Received messages are displayed in a standard way.

Now, a while back, AOL opened up external mail access for its users via IMAP. Unfortunately, my attempts to do so failed. For now, you&#8217;ll have to access your mail either through the web, or through their new beta _Triton_ client. Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t confirm that as the current beta still lacks the ability to be installed when behind a proxy (which is why I despise downloading installers; it&#8217;s obnoxious).

So, if you&#8217;re still looking for a free webmail address and have some aversion to Gmail (perhaps because [you&#8217;re paranoid to the point of living in a shack in the woods](http://www.gmail-is-too-creepy.com)), you have yet another decent option.
