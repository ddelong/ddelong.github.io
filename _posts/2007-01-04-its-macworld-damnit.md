Something has been building steadily for a couple weeks now and I just can&#8217;t contain it anymore. After countless hours of reading though, the rage within me has reached the spilling level. I read nearly every Mac website I can find (via RSS). I can give non-Mac news sources a pass on this, but the rest of you should hang your heads in shame.

Macworld, as in Macworld Magazine and Macworld Expo, is spelled as I have it. Macworld Expo is like Mecca, but for Mac users. It&#8217;s the ultimate event in the Mac universe. Given that fact, why is it so god damned hard to spell it right?

I&#8217;ve noticed two groups are the worst offenders, or at least get under my skin the most: vendors sending out promotional emails and Mac news outlets and blogs. The two most common misspellings are MacWorld and Mac World. Let me tell you something guys, it&#8217;s your responsibility to at least be able to spell the name of the event.

The news sites/blogs are the worst because they act as authoritative sources about Mac culture and information. How am I supposed to take your predictions and prognostications seriously when you don&#8217;t even spell it right. No matter how hard I try to displace my thoughts, all those articles end up looking like:

> At teh MacWorld expo I preedict the AWEsome iPhone!!11!!!!!11!!

So please, I beg of the Mac community: spell it right. Don&#8217;t look like an idiot. Don&#8217;t make us all look like idiots.
