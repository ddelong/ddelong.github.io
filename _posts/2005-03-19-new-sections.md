Listed under _Pages_ and _Site Sections_ are some new additions to the site.

I'm giving you all the tools to stalk me online. You can see what I'm doing with [43 Things](/43things/), the music, movies, and games I have in my [library](/library/), if I'm sitting in front of computer with the [webcam](/webcam/), the movies I'm getting from [Netflix](/netflix/), an assortment of pictures at [Flickr](/flickr/), and now the music I'm listening to at the [music section](/music/).

Web services at [43 Things](http://www.43things.com), [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com), and [Flickr](http://flickr.com) supply the data in those respective sections. The library is powered by [Delicious Library](http://www.delicious-monster.com) and [DeliciWeb](http://homepage.mac.com/imaxinc/DeliciWeb/). The webcam is powered by [EvoCam](http://www.evological.com/evocam.html). Finally, [Recent Tunes](http://freshsqueeze.com/products/freeware/) supplies the data for the music section.

It's all automated, making this site dynamic without my intervention. Sweet.
