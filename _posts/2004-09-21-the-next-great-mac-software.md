While it has mostly gone unnoticed until this point, [Growl](http://growl.info) is some of the coolest new software around. It doesn't do much on its own right now, but it won't be long before lots of your software utilizes it.

Growl provides a notification system for all your applications. All a developer need do is send notifications to it. Current applications that you can use with it are:

  * [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com)
  * [Fire](http://fire.sf.net)
  * iTunes
  * Mail
  * [gCount](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~natan/gcount/)
  * _&#8230;and more_

Growl has been around for a little, but only recently was a build offered to the public. Some warnings need be said. gCount will need an update to use the newly released build. You'll need a version of [Adium 0.7](http://www.adiumx.com/beta.html) (currently in beta).

I personally like to use [Synergy](http://synergy.wincent.com) for iTunes stuff and [Mail Appetizer](http://www.bronsonbeta.com/mailappetizer/) for Mail notifications, but I like having this universal system in place. We can expect to see a lot more use for it.
