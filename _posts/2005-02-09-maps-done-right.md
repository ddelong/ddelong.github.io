[Google](http://www.google.com)&#8216;s [services](http://www.google.com/options/) are growing quickly. Very quickly. First it was just a web search engine. Then they added [image searching](http://images.google.com) (of course, it still has its [kinks](/weblog/2005/02/05/thank-you-dana/)). They added [newsgroups](http://groups.google.com), [news](http://news.google.com), and [price searching](http://froogle.google.com), aka Froogle. That wasn&#8217;t enough though. They added a [free email service](http://www.gmail.com) (I have 6 invitations sitting around doing nothing for anyone interested) and [desktop searching](http://desktop.google.com) which still doesn&#8217;t support Macs, Firefox, or Thunderbird. I&#8217;m still leaving out [countless other products and services](http://www.google.com/options/).

Very recently, their new [&#8220;local&#8221; service](http://local.google.com) added things like finding restaurants and other businesses. As I played with it, I noticed something. They had their own maps embedded in those searches. It wasn&#8217;t [Yahoo Maps](http://maps.yahoo.com) or [MapQuest](http://www.mapquest.com) based. I personally preferred the former to the latter. My suspicion was well founded as Google is publically beta testing their new [Map service](http://maps.google.com). It uses some very new browser tricks (standards based) to make the maps interactive without any heavy Java or endless page loading. My words can&#8217;t do it justice, so check it out for yourself.
