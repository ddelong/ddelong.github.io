In what is becoming a bi-weekly tradition for this site, I&#8217;ve gotten my website fixed again.

The real question is how long will it hold up. It&#8217;s rather frustrating for me as this website has become my main hobby and any time I think I&#8217;m beginning to make headway in some kind of readership, the site goes down. What&#8217;s worse is that I&#8217;m paying for this service. This is the first time that I actually went out and bought hosting for this purpose and I&#8217;m getting worse results than I got on free hosts. It&#8217;s unacceptable.

I&#8217;m going to have to find some solution to avoid this week in and out. Considering the software I&#8217;m using is perfectly stable in other environments, I&#8217;m leaning towards a new host. It seems that anything trying to access outside resources eventually breaks (with, as of yet, no explanation from my host). Unfortunately for me, I bought in for a year of service with these people but pretty soon I&#8217;m going to have to start taking drastic measures.

I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be half as frustrated if they simply took me seriously. I have to exchange half a dozen emails with random people until I finally find one that realizes I know what I&#8217;m talking about. Further, I do half the work for them by setting up [simple test case reductions](/troubleshooting/) in order to point out that there is nothing wrong with WordPress or the plugins I&#8217;m using. Again, I&#8217;ve been using WordPress for **months** now without problems, then a month or two ago, I started getting this transient problem.

If this problem happens again and I&#8217;m not taken seriously, I&#8217;m going to go on a one-man crusade to make their lives hell because I&#8217;m the god damn customer in this situation and I demand satisfaction.
