I can&#8217;t help but feel like I&#8217;ve abused the good ranking I get with this blog on Google, but when I [complained about the stress ball I had that squirted over my shirt]() (the Morf ball), I didn&#8217;t expect to get a response from the company. I certainly didn&#8217;t expect this kind of response.

As a result, we&#8217;d love to send you a complimentary Cyber Gel Squeeze Ball, our other popular stress reliever. Rest assured, this item will not explode or leak. Please provide us with your shipping address, and I will have them sent out to you ASAP.

Naturally I&#8217;ll take them up on the offer. This is a new level of customer service. Not only are they going to replace a product, but they searched me out. Take a look at [their site](http://www.handstands.com) and order anything that catches your eye.
