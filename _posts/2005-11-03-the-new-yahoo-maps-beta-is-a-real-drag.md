Yahoo Maps is back with a new vengeance with [their new beta](http://maps.yahoo.com/beta/). It&#8217;s like Google Maps, but with some new features like a tiny overview map showing what your context is from a farther perspective. That&#8217;s slick.

Even better, you can superimpose current traffic conditions. Finally! This is going to hold my attention over Google Maps, at least for a while. I like. Now if only I could get my hands on that Yahoo Mail beta to see if it really beats Gmail.
