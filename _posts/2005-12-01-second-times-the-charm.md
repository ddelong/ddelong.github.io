We may have finally reached the final chapter in the Linksys Compact Wireless router (WRT54GC) saga. The replacement arrived today. I started first by upgrading the firmware with Firefox. It went through without a hitch.

So far, I like it, but what I&#8217;ve read about poor range looks to be true. That said, it may not be the fairest comparison when matched with my DI-624, in whose [review on CNet](http://reviews.cnet.com/D_Link_DI_624_router/4505-3319_7-20817312.html?tag=pop) was noted for long range.

> **The good:** Fast; long range; removable antenna; configurable firewall; compact.

It&#8217;s actually pretty amusing that it was noted for being compact. It illustrates the age of the review. I&#8217;ll try to put a more comprehensive review together in the coming days including pictures.
