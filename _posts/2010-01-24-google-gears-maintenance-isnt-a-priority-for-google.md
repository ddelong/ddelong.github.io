The recent Firefox 3.6 update made me re-examine my add-ons as always. What struck me as odd was that Google Gears wasn't compatible. Clearly that was a mistake. Google couldn't possibly ignore the chosen browser of most of the tech elite.

It's not totally ignored no. Indeed there's a ticket for the problem. It has a Medium priority. Medium? Not working with Firefox isn't that important?

That got me thinking. The last time I checked, the latest Safari in Snow Leopard wasn't supported. Still true. Also has a Medium priority.

So, it's not supported on Safari in Snow Leopard, the latest Firefox, or Chrome for Mac OS X. That leaves&#8230; nothing. No Snow Leopard support using the latest browsers.

There's two conclusions. First, Google Gears isn't a priority for Google. Second, Mac OS X support isn't a priority for Google. Take your pick.

**Edit:** Turns out that I missed the Google announcement that Gears was effectively dead in favor of HTML5's storage capability. While a move to a standard is good, nowhere on Google's Gears site does it mention this fact. Indeed this fact probably makes all non-security Gears tickets a &#8220;WONT-FIX&#8221; but it's very poorly being communicated and does nothing to address the fact that today's sites with offline capabilities still use Gears.

In order to get any satisfaction as a Snow Leopard user, you'll need to download Firefox 3.5.x. That's a little backward.

**Update:** [Finally](http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/hello-html5.html), some kind of acknowledgement.
