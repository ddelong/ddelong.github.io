The recent Firefox 3.6 update made me re-examine my add-ons as always. What struck me as odd was that Google Gears wasn&#8217;t compatible. Clearly that was a mistake. Google couldn&#8217;t possibly ignore the chosen browser of most of the tech elite.

It&#8217;s not totally ignored no. Indeed there&#8217;s a ticket for the problem. It has a Medium priority. Medium? Not working with Firefox isn&#8217;t that important?

That got me thinking. The last time I checked, the latest Safari in Snow Leopard wasn&#8217;t supported. Still true. Also has a Medium priority.

So, it&#8217;s not supported on Safari in Snow Leopard, the latest Firefox, or Chrome for Mac OS X. That leaves&#8230; nothing. No Snow Leopard support using the latest browsers.

There&#8217;s two conclusions. First, Google Gears isn&#8217;t a priority for Google. Second, Mac OS X support isn&#8217;t a priority for Google. Take your pick.

**Edit:** Turns out that I missed the Google announcement that Gears was effectively dead in favor of HTML5&#8217;s storage capability. While a move to a standard is good, nowhere on Google&#8217;s Gears site does it mention this fact. Indeed this fact probably makes all non-security Gears tickets a &#8220;WONT-FIX&#8221; but it&#8217;s very poorly being communicated and does nothing to address the fact that today&#8217;s sites with offline capabilities still use Gears.

In order to get any satisfaction as a Snow Leopard user, you&#8217;ll need to download Firefox 3.5.x. That&#8217;s a little backward.

**Update:** [Finally](http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/hello-html5.html), some kind of acknowledgement.
