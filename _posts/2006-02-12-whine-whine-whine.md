Like any hardcore [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com) user, I read [Hacking Netflix](http://www.hackingnetflix.com). One of the more repetitive, annoying themes is the dissatisfaction of [Manuel](http://www.manuelsweb.com/netflix.htm). If you thought I was obsessive about Macs, well, it&#8217;s nothing compared to this guy and Netflix. And it has to be bad. In fact, he takes this quest so seriously that it has shades of a [Don Quixote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote) syndrome. Netflix is one mighty windmill. He&#8217;s [pulled the AP in](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060210/ap_en_mo/netflix_throttling_2) as his Sancho Panza. It even has a picture of him. Lovely.

Now, that&#8217;s not to say that Netflix is perfect. I&#8217;ve had a few broken/scratched discs and sometimes they can&#8217;t find discs I&#8217;ve returned until I report them missing (then they turn up that afternoon). Overall, I&#8217;m a very satisfied customer and I don&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;re restricting my use. Rather, I tend &#8220;throttle&#8221; (slow usage) myself because I&#8217;m too busy to watch that many movies. I&#8217;ve done the analysis and I&#8217;m getting good value out of my account.

For some real Netflix analysis though, I&#8217;d check out [Mike&#8217;s Netflix analysis](http://www.planetmike.com/netflix/) though it hasn&#8217;t been updated in a little while. **Update:** _Look at the power I yield, Mike updated his graph._ It&#8217;s far more complete than Manuel&#8217;s anecdotal account of Netflix quality. On an up note, if our society has progressed to the point where this becomes the main concern for someone, we&#8217;re doing pretty good.
