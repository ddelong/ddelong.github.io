Like any hardcore [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com) user, I read [Hacking Netflix](http://www.hackingnetflix.com). One of the more repetitive, annoying themes is the dissatisfaction of [Manuel](http://www.manuelsweb.com/netflix.htm). If you thought I was obsessive about Macs, well, it's nothing compared to this guy and Netflix. And it has to be bad. In fact, he takes this quest so seriously that it has shades of a [Don Quixote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote) syndrome. Netflix is one mighty windmill. He's [pulled the AP in](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060210/ap_en_mo/netflix_throttling_2) as his Sancho Panza. It even has a picture of him. Lovely.

Now, that's not to say that Netflix is perfect. I've had a few broken/scratched discs and sometimes they can't find discs I've returned until I report them missing (then they turn up that afternoon). Overall, I'm a very satisfied customer and I don't feel like they're restricting my use. Rather, I tend &#8220;throttle&#8221; (slow usage) myself because I'm too busy to watch that many movies. I've done the analysis and I'm getting good value out of my account.

For some real Netflix analysis though, I'd check out [Mike's Netflix analysis](http://www.planetmike.com/netflix/) though it hasn't been updated in a little while. **Update:** _Look at the power I yield, Mike updated his graph._ It's far more complete than Manuel's anecdotal account of Netflix quality. On an up note, if our society has progressed to the point where this becomes the main concern for someone, we're doing pretty good.
