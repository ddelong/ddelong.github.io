Some of my friends ([Katie](http://www.livejournal.com/users/kayteebird/) and [Dana](http://xandriamd87.blogspot.com)) use free blogging services, namely, [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com) and [Blogger/Blogspot](http://www.blogger.com) respectively. I personally went straight to Movable Type and then WordPress hosted on my own domain.

Of those two choices I&#8217;d tend to go with Blogger. It&#8217;s owned by Google now, so there&#8217;s plenty of growth potential. Probably the main reason would be that I actually dislike LiveJournal because: it&#8217;s slow, its themes are applied only to the front page (comment pages are the horrendous style of the rest of the site), it&#8217;s slow, you are forced into a long address (even blogspot gives you a subdomain), it&#8217;s slow, everyone and their brother has an account there so you&#8217;re forced into an obscure AIM screename-ish username, and did I mention it&#8217;s slow? Yeah. I don&#8217;t like LiveJournal&#8230; at all&#8230; in any way&#8230; shape&#8230; or form.

I&#8217;m curious though, what do y&#8217;all use and why?
