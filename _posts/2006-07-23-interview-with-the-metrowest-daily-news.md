Despite my sporadic blogging here lately, I got chosen to be interviewed with a local newspaper, [the MetroWest Daily News](http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/), for an article in their Sunday edition today. I haven&#8217;t seen the finished product, but we talked about blogging, professional blogging, journalistic integrity, and a blog&#8217;s effect upon your job and career in general.

Hopefully I&#8217;ll come across as insightful. I&#8217;ll try to post the link once it appears on the website.

**Update:** [The article is up.](http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/businessNews/view.bg?articleid=136067) The print version lacked my picture. I don&#8217;t know why, but I&#8217;ll suggest it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m so attractive.
