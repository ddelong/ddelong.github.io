Despite my sporadic blogging here lately, I got chosen to be interviewed with a local newspaper, [the MetroWest Daily News](http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/), for an article in their Sunday edition today. I haven't seen the finished product, but we talked about blogging, professional blogging, journalistic integrity, and a blog's effect upon your job and career in general.

Hopefully I'll come across as insightful. I'll try to post the link once it appears on the website.

**Update:** [The article is up.](http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/businessNews/view.bg?articleid=136067) The print version lacked my picture. I don't know why, but I'll suggest it's because I'm so attractive.
