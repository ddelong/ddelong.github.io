Most people don&#8217;t pay attention to their keyboard. I didn&#8217;t either for a long time. I actually loved the feel of my Pismo&#8217;s keyboard. The scissor key design made for keys that wore very well and pushing on any part of the key had equal resistance. When I started converting my Pismo into mutated desktop, I decided to get an external keyboard. That started my hunt for the perfect keyboard. <!--more--> After thorough research (as I do with every product I buy), I decided on an iKey4 keyboard made by Macally. It was a nice change of pace. It was a far more mechanical keyboard. It was louder and had more resistance. I actually liked the key action. What didn&#8217;t I like? The complete lack of volume keys on the keyboard itself. I kept using it and dealt without those keys, but boy, did I miss them.

It wasn&#8217;t long before I broke down and got an actual desktop, my MDD Powermac. That of course came with the Apple Pro Keyboard. The key action wasn&#8217;t as good as my iKey, but the volume and eject keys made up for it. I adopted that as my new keyboard.

That is until I spilled beer all over it. I freaked and remembered reading that one could dunk keyboards in water and they&#8217;d be all right. Well, I got the beer out, but my keyboard didn&#8217;t work. I had left my iKey several hours away at my home, but I needed a keyboard to do my work. This led to buying a Logitech Internet Navigator keyboard, which had a full array of keys. It had keys for almost everything. The key action was ok, comparable to Apple&#8217;s Pro Keyboard. The problem is that Logitech&#8217;s drivers aren&#8217;t that good and using the command and shift keys together on the right side would somehow make the keyboard think I was holding the control key and until I tapped it, it wouldn&#8217;t quit. My Apple Pro Keyboard dried out and became usable again, so I went back to it.

The left shift key became sticky (ok, ok, I spilled beer on it twice more). I thought I fix it using some silicon spray. That had an effect. The effect of making the key completely inoperable. I finally had motivation to get yet another keyboard. After careful research, I chose the Macally IceKey.

What attracted me first was the scissor-key design, which is used in Apple laptops (including my Pismo, upon which I&#8217;m actually typing this). It also has the same exact keys as the Apple Pro Keyboard (which I found to be all the ones I actually used; I didn&#8217;t use like any of the extra keys on the Logitech). Finally, reviews indicated great key action and they weren&#8217;t lying. Key action may be a subjective thing (some prefer extra firm, some soft), but I found the IceKey to have a nice balance of soft, but firm, with a clear snap when a key is pressed. The keyboard itself is nice and thin, taking up little room. At a price of <$45, it's a good investment and far more cost effective than the Matias keyboards that go for $100. I highly recommend it!
