Just for fun, I decided that I would check [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) related feeds feature on my weblog. [The results](http://www.bloglines.com/relatedfeeds?siteid=584982) were rather surprising. Every single &#8220;related&#8221; feed was &#8220;en espanol.&#8221;

For the life of me, I can not figure this out. What exactly about my site makes it similar to these sites? I certainly don&#8217;t use any spanish.
