Many of you may be familiar with the uber text editor, [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml). I recently upgraded to the 8.0 version of this fine utility.

My verdict? Well, it's pretty similar to 7.0. There are a few key new things that made it worth the upgrade price to me. The first is the document sidebar. Instead of having a few dozen windows open, you can have just one and switch between them. This is a big win for small screen users (like those of us with 12&#8243; Powerbooks). It also highlights the current line, which seems minor, but is amazingly useful. Hunting down the cursor can be a real chore, so this is a real time-saver. It also lets you the system spell-checker (which I've become addicted to.

Unix buffs will also like the improved &#8220;bbedit&#8221; command (which lets you pipe text into it). Also very useful is the new &#8220;bbdiff&#8221; command, which lets you compare two files from the terminal with BBEdit. Cool!

There are [other features](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/new.shtml) which aren't quite as important to me, but may be of interest to some. So check it out! You may find it's worth the $49 upgrade fee.
