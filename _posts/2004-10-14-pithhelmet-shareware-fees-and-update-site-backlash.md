The author of PithHelmet recently [wrote a short piece on shareware fees and software update site feedback](http://www.culater.net/thc/index.php?entry=/Development/registration_project.txt). It&#8217;s disheartening to think that this is becoming increasingly common. Mike worked very hard on PithHelmet 2 to make it far suprior to the open-source, free PithHelmet 0.7.3. He added quality features like Machete (which allows you to filter web pages through a perl or Python script) which I have not seen on any other browser. He continues to distribute 0.7.3 for free, but apparently that&#8217;s not good enough for some users.

Further, one &#8220;reviewer&#8221; at Macupdate demanded that Mike go to Macupdate to answer his questions. That has to be the single most infantile act I&#8217;ve seen at a software version tracking site (and I&#8217;ve seen some pretty dumb things).

This type of idiotic behavior is commonplace on these sites. At one point, I heeded reviews on these sites. They were fair, balanced, and in-depth. Now it&#8217;s filled with 1 and 5 star reviews, no in between. Wonderful. The 1 start reviews are filled with such intellectual gems as:

  * _And if an author wants to persuade you of its harmlessness, kick off his balls!_ 
  * _Here&#8217;s to hoping that Net Monitor dies the slow, painful death that all suckerware deserves._
  *  _Just another POS from Alpha Omega._
  * _Especially when one spent two years by nothing else than scratching his sphincter._
  *  _GIVE US BACK SOUNDJAM, you ignorant Apple idiots!_ 
  *  _What else from people who are permanently to stupid and ignorant to even fill in a &#8220;What&#8217;s new&#8221;? Avoid this piece of bullsh1t_

Once again, the prevalence of the Internet is starting to bite us in the ass. People who can&#8217;t tie their shoes or put together a coherent sentence are offering their &#8220;expert&#8221; advice.

Here&#8217;s to hoping that the Internet community will fight back against these &#8220;scholars&#8221;.
