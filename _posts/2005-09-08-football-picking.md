I know it's late notice, but I just got turned on to Yahoo's Football Pick'em page (like what I did last year, but automated, so scrap that idea).

Anyway, I expect all of you to join and participate especially [Henry](http://www.hbusby.com) (that's two mentions), [Dana](http://xandriamd87.blogspot.com), and [Katie](http://www.livejournal.com/~kayteebird/). The group has 50 slots, so if it comes to that, it'll be first come, first serve.

You need a Yahoo! id and enough time to pick teams to win (no spread) and assign confidence (1 &#8211; 16). Each week's picks have to be in 5 minutes prior to the first game of the week. The Patriots are playing tonight, so you'll need to enter your choices before then.

In order to join the group, just go to [Pro Football Pick'em](http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/pickem), click the &#8220;Sign Up&#8221; button (or &#8220;Create or Join Group&#8221; if you are a returning user). From there, follow the path to join an existing private group and when prompted, enter the following information&#8230;

**Group ID#:** 40151
  
**Password:** slappy

I'll post my weekly results and analysis of the group's performance each week. Sign up now!
