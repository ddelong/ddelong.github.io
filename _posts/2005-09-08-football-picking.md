I know it&#8217;s late notice, but I just got turned on to Yahoo&#8217;s Football Pick&#8217;em page (like what I did last year, but automated, so scrap that idea).

Anyway, I expect all of you to join and participate especially [Henry](http://www.hbusby.com) (that&#8217;s two mentions), [Dana](http://xandriamd87.blogspot.com), and [Katie](http://www.livejournal.com/~kayteebird/). The group has 50 slots, so if it comes to that, it&#8217;ll be first come, first serve.

You need a Yahoo! id and enough time to pick teams to win (no spread) and assign confidence (1 &#8211; 16). Each week&#8217;s picks have to be in 5 minutes prior to the first game of the week. The Patriots are playing tonight, so you&#8217;ll need to enter your choices before then.

In order to join the group, just go to [Pro Football Pick&#8217;em](http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/pickem), click the &#8220;Sign Up&#8221; button (or &#8220;Create or Join Group&#8221; if you are a returning user). From there, follow the path to join an existing private group and when prompted, enter the following information&#8230;

**Group ID#:** 40151
  
**Password:** slappy

I&#8217;ll post my weekly results and analysis of the group&#8217;s performance each week. Sign up now!
