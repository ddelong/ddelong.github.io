Like RSS/Atom feeds? Have Gmail? Let&#8217;s combine the two!

Fire up your RSS reader and plug this URL into it: <https://gmail.google.com/gmail/feed/atom>

If your RSS reader is done right, it should probe you for a username and password. Plug _username_@gmail.com (the entire thing) into the username field and your password in the, no surprise, password field.

Please note that any changes you make in your RSS reader will not be reflected in your Gmail inbox. This feed is simply a listing of the currently unread contents of your inbox.

Now we get to see some of the benefits of the [Google Blogger acquisition](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000802.shtml#000802).
