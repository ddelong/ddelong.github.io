Last night, I picked up my futon. This isn't a cheap dorm room adornment. This is high quality baby (like $440 high quality).

I bought it Saturday, so I had to wait a couple days for it. I was so anxious that even though we weren't back and done with dinner until 10 PM, I still wanted to assemble it. My father and I had it assembled in less than an hour.

Now all that's left is to christen my self-proclaimed flip & fuck. Unfortunately, work absorbs nearly all of my time during the week. It's pretty unbelievable until you actually start doing it for real.

I'll take some pictures and post them up, along with the other things I promised to photograph.
