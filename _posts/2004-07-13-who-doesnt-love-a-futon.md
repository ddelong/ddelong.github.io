Last night, I picked up my futon. This isn&#8217;t a cheap dorm room adornment. This is high quality baby (like $440 high quality).

I bought it Saturday, so I had to wait a couple days for it. I was so anxious that even though we weren&#8217;t back and done with dinner until 10 PM, I still wanted to assemble it. My father and I had it assembled in less than an hour.

Now all that&#8217;s left is to christen my self-proclaimed flip & fuck. Unfortunately, work absorbs nearly all of my time during the week. It&#8217;s pretty unbelievable until you actually start doing it for real.

I&#8217;ll take some pictures and post them up, along with the other things I promised to photograph.
