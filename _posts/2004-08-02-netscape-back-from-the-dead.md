Netscape fans will be thrilled to hear that reports of Netscape&#8217;s death have been greatly exaggerated. Netscape 7.2 will be making its debut very soon as reported by [MacMinute](http://www.macminute.com/2004/08/01/netscapeupdate).

From what I had read earlier, this new version will be based on Mozilla 1.7, which is one of Mozilla&#8217;s most stable releases. In fact, I believe that was their priority issue for that milestone.

This doesn&#8217;t affect me so much as I use Safari on my Macs and Firefox on my work computer. It is a good thing for those that refuse to use anything but the big two (Internet Explorer and Netscape). It also means that modern Mozilla-based executables will begin gracing corporate desktops again as well (again, because support is generally restricted to the big two).

I&#8217;ve already sold my friends on Firefox, but others will be excited by Netscape 7.2&#8217;s new speed and enhancements. Kudos to Netscape for continuing to use new Mozilla milestones instead of older releases as they did for Netscape 6.x and 7.0.
