Netscape fans will be thrilled to hear that reports of Netscape's death have been greatly exaggerated. Netscape 7.2 will be making its debut very soon as reported by [MacMinute](http://www.macminute.com/2004/08/01/netscapeupdate).

From what I had read earlier, this new version will be based on Mozilla 1.7, which is one of Mozilla's most stable releases. In fact, I believe that was their priority issue for that milestone.

This doesn't affect me so much as I use Safari on my Macs and Firefox on my work computer. It is a good thing for those that refuse to use anything but the big two (Internet Explorer and Netscape). It also means that modern Mozilla-based executables will begin gracing corporate desktops again as well (again, because support is generally restricted to the big two).

I've already sold my friends on Firefox, but others will be excited by Netscape 7.2's new speed and enhancements. Kudos to Netscape for continuing to use new Mozilla milestones instead of older releases as they did for Netscape 6.x and 7.0.
