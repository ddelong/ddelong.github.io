Back in December, I [made some predictions](http://godlikenerd.com/weblog/2005/12/09/macworld-expo-san-francisco/).

The quick recap is, I was completely right about the Powerbook (though I didn't see the moronic name change coming). I didn't see the iMac coming. The Mac mini rumor was nice, but ultimately, it wasn't in the cards. My hope clouded my judgment.

iLife '06 and iWork '06: Yawn. Again.

I'm surprised at the complete lack of information about Leopard. The prospect of getting surprised is actually exciting. Apple may just sit on the features until after Vista appears. That might slow Microsoft just a bit. <!-- technorati tags start -->
