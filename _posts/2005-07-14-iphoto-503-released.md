Apple released the [iPhoto 5.0.3 update](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/iphoto503update.html) yesterday. Normally, iApp updates aren&#8217;t particularly exciting. In fact, the details are excruciatingly boring.

Here are the changes according to Apple:

>   * On Tiger, images are no longer color-shifted after editing _(Mac OS X 10.4.2 update required)_
>   * Book layouts will not change when moving an image on a page
>   * An issue was addressed that caused some book orders to be cancelled
>   * Smart Albums will display correctly in other iLife applications

Normally, I&#8217;d ignore this and just install it, but the first bullet is the interesting one. It fixes a problem that has rather [profound effects](http://www.brendanloy.com/archives/018071.html). Generally, it&#8217;s referred to as the iPhoto color shifting bug. The linked article is probably the best documentation of the bug I&#8217;ve seen (complete with animation). At any rate, it means I can start editing photos again.
