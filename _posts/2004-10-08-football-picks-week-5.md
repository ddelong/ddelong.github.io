I&#8217;ll admit it. I screwed up a bit with last week&#8217;s picks. 9-5 is not good. This makes me 20-8 overall.

Hopefully this week is better.

  * NY Giants vs. **Dallas**
  * **Minnesota** vs. Houston
  * Oakland vs. **Indianapolis**
  * Miami vs. **New England**
  * Tampa Bay vs. **New Orleans**
  * Cleveland vs. **Pittsburgh**
  * Buffalo vs. **NY Jets**
  * **Jacksonville** vs. San Diego
