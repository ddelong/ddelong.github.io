The last few days, I&#8217;ve been playing with the CSS that renders the site for me. I&#8217;ve now given the weblog a page-like look (notice the border on all sides). Normally, that bugs the crap out of me on websites, but I&#8217;ve tried to keep it a small border to make things look nicer. I&#8217;ve also removed the numbering of the comments and gave them dashed line separators.

Next up is to add a logo of some kind (and a favicon because I&#8217;m sure all of you are tired at looking at the generic icon for this site). I&#8217;ll have to try my hand at designing them both myself as no one offered to help this artistically stupid programmer.

Let me know what you think of the changes.
