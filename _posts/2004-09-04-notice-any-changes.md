The last few days, I've been playing with the CSS that renders the site for me. I've now given the weblog a page-like look (notice the border on all sides). Normally, that bugs the crap out of me on websites, but I've tried to keep it a small border to make things look nicer. I've also removed the numbering of the comments and gave them dashed line separators.

Next up is to add a logo of some kind (and a favicon because I'm sure all of you are tired at looking at the generic icon for this site). I'll have to try my hand at designing them both myself as no one offered to help this artistically stupid programmer.

Let me know what you think of the changes.
