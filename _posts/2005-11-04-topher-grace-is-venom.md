<span class="float-left"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/2/3779052_e807c110a4_m_d.jpg" alt="Topher Grace" /></span> Someone please tell me that someone is screwing with IMDB. [Topher Grace](http://imdb.com/name/nm0333410/) is supposed to play Venom in the upcoming [Spider-Man 3](http://imdb.com/title/tt0413300/) according to IMDB.

Didn't someone already play Eddie Brock in the earlier Spider-Man movies? I might be wrong, but I remember pointing it out to someone. Let's ignore that because actors are regularly replaced.

Topher Grace though? Venom is a powerful, violent killer. He inspires terror in people. Does this this face scare you? Really?
