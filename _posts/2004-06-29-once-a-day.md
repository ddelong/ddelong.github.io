Once of my favorite websites is [RailHead Design](http://www.railheaddesign.com). It&#8217;s become a daily stop because, well, it&#8217;s updated every day (at least during the week). I&#8217;m resolving myself to having the same discipline (though my entries tend to be a bit longer than Maury&#8217;s). Starting today and happening every day unless I go on vacation, I will be adding at least one new entry.

I&#8217;ll probably borrow (ok, steal) from sources such as [Obscure Store](http://www.obscurestore.com), [Fark](http://www.fark.com), and [Maccentral](http://www.maccentral.com) to fill the void on days when I have nothing good or interesting to say.

Oh, and a quick reminder, there is an RSS feed for my blog over on the right side of the page. Be sure to fire up your favorite RSS reader (or get [NetNewsWire](http://www.ranchero.com/netnewswire) (regular or lite) if you&#8217;re on a Mac, [Feedreader](http://www.feedreader.com) if you&#8217;re on Windows (I&#8217;ll suggest another one if some can suggest a really good Windows RSS client; I haven&#8217;t had much luck), or get [Firebird&#8217;s](http://www.mozilla.org) RSS Extension) and add it to your list.
