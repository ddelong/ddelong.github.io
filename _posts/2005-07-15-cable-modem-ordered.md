Those of you that I talk to daily already know why I&#8217;m ordering a new [D-Link DCM-202](http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=1&pid=323). Please don&#8217;t mention it in the comments. I&#8217;m going to be all superstitious about it and write a big post about it later.

[![DCM-202](http://photos23.flickr.com/26343867_889db39128_s.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/19959606@N00/26343867 "DCM-202"){.float-right}Anyway, at about [$40 with mail-in rebate at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=d00dism-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B0002JKGRQ%2526tag=d00dism-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B0002JKGRQ%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon") with DOCSIS 2.0, this was **the** modem to get. I won&#8217;t be posting a review for a while, but I&#8217;ll do all kinds of testing when I do. I&#8217;ll use Skype, Gizmo, Vonage (as I&#8217;ll likely be getting that too), Bittorrent, and so on. There won&#8217;t be anything too formal (as switching between a couple cable modems isn&#8217;t really an option, nor something I want to do), but I will be able to definitively say whether I think it sucks.
