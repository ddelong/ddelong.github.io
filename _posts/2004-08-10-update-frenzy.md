Apple has not only released an OS update for Panther and a security update for Jaguar, but they&#8217;ve also included several other key updates:

  * iPhoto 2.0.1
  * Java 1.4.2 Update 1
  * iSync 1.5

I don&#8217;t feel like linking them up, so hit Software Update or your favorite software update site (like Versiontracker).

iSync 1.5 brings support for new devices, including the Motorola V710 (Verizon&#8217;s first Bluetooth phone). The bad news is that Verizon will be crippling the V710 to promote sales in their own ring-tone service. That means that syncing will take place over a USB cable only. While this is better than nothing, it means I&#8217;ll either be waiting to see if a Nokia Bluetooth phone will grace Verizon&#8217;s lineup with fully functional Bluetooth or get a cheaper Motorola with USB syncing (like the V60s). It&#8217;s disappointing to say the least.
