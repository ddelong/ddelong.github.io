I don&#8217;t care what you are doing tomorrow. You&#8217;re going to make the time to get Firefox 1.0. Places that will most likely have download links:

  * [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org)
  * [Mozillazine](http://mozillazine.org)
  * [Spread Firefox](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&id=1747)
  * [Get Firefox](http://getfirefox.com)
  * [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org)

It&#8217;s likely to be a bandwidth bonanza, so be sure to find a mirror or BitTorrent feed.
