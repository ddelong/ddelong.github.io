Time for me to brag a little. During my softball game on Tuesday night, I got on base every time I came to bat. I&#8217;m not talking about just one or two at-bats. I was up four times. One was a triple with two or three RBIs.

Of course, my fielding is still weak-ass, but I&#8217;ll sweep that under the rug.
