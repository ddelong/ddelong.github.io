All I can say is finally. [Paul Beard](http://www.paulbeard.org/wordpress/index.php?p=2430) brings us the news that CNN has finally joined the rest of modern online society and started offering their content in RSS feeds. It works great. I find it particularly useful because although the New York Times [offers feeds](http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/index.html), they're woefully inadequate. The Front Page feed is only six long. That means for most people that unless they continually check their RSS reader, stories are likely to slide off the feed before you get a chance to look at them. Such a fast moving page needs more history in the feed. CNN's is much longer and I honestly prefer their reporting.

If you're lazy and you don't want to go to Paul's site for the feeds, here they are:

  * CNN Top Stories: <http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss>
  * CNN Most Popular: <http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_mostpopular.rss>
  * Money Top Stories: <http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_topstories.rss>
  * Money Most Popular: <http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_mostpopular.rss>
  * Sports Illustrated Top Stories: <http://rss.cnn.com/rss/si_topstories.rss>

**Update:** CNN has a [page dedicated to their RSS support](http://www.cnn.com/services/rss/).
