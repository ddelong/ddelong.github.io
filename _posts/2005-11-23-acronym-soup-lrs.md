Ever since [Woot](http://woot.com) sent me a Motorola WA840G by mistake, it&#8217;s been augmenting my parent&#8217;s wired network as a wireless access point. It&#8217;s been working great for their needs (connecting my old Pismo via its Airport card).

When I got home today for a Thanksgiving stay, I decided I&#8217;d update the firmware on all their network devices. The old Linksys router&#8217;s firmware hasn&#8217;t been updated in quite a while. That&#8217;s fine because the thing is rock solid. The Motorola access point had a new version with many new features, so I updated it.

Other than having to configure everything again, it all looked good. That is until my brother told me that my old Powerbook couldn&#8217;t connect. I tried turning the card off and on again and restarting. No dice. I decided to turn everything off and then on again. Of course, that&#8217;s when Charter decided to have some issues.

Regardless of those issues, I should still have been able to connect to the access point with the old Powerbook. I couldn&#8217;t. I thought maybe I had turned off 802.11b compatibility (the Pismo has regular Airport while my current Powerbook has Airport Express). Visiting the WA840G&#8217;s configuration page showed that it was set for &#8220;compatibility&#8221; but the other options were &#8220;performance&#8221;, &#8220;LRS&#8221;, and &#8220;802.11b only&#8221;. I&#8217;ll be damned if I could figure out what &#8220;LRS&#8221; stood for, but it afforded extra compatibility for 802.11b clients according the description.

Once that was set as the operating mode, the Pismo connected to the access point perfectly. I really wish this was explained better in Motorola&#8217;s documentation, but it&#8217;s worth noting for those having problems, even if I don&#8217;t know why it works.
