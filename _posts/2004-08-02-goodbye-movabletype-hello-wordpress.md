Following confirmation from Ranchero software that NetNewsWire does indeed work with WordPress, I&#8217;ve decided to move to it. Partly was to keep current and partly because of some of its features are compelling.

I won&#8217;t be making any more entries until the migration is complete. I&#8217;ll also be making my blog the front page for my domain. Stay tuned!
