After another week of work and 5 hour nights, I got to sleep in this morning. I woke up at the early hour of 11 AM, but went back to sleep another 3 hours.

I can&#8217;t articulate how wonderful this is (well, except essentially losing the entire day). I had dreams I could remember for the first time this week.

Maybe it&#8217;s because I still have the collegiate habit of staying up too late, but weekends are better than peanut butter and fluff.
