[Hacking Netflix](http://www.hackingnetflix.com) had an [article on &#8220;the worst movie ever&#8221;](http://www.hackingnetflix.com/netflix/2005/06/the_worst_movie.html). The article mentioned that [Netflix](http://netflix.com) carried the [Mystery Science Theater 3000 version](http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70003577&mqso=60186664&trkid=129129).

I never thought of the possibility that Netflix had MST3K. But they do! In fact, they have a large selection (27 by my count) and they're all in my queue now (which has reached triple digits in size). Does anyone else have the same desire to watch them all?
