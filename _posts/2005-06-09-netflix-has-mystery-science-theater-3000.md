[Hacking Netflix](http://www.hackingnetflix.com) had an [article on &#8220;the worst movie ever&#8221;](http://www.hackingnetflix.com/netflix/2005/06/the_worst_movie.html). The article mentioned that [Netflix](http://netflix.com) carried the [Mystery Science Theater 3000 version](http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70003577&mqso=60186664&trkid=129129).

I never thought of the possibility that Netflix had MST3K. But they do! In fact, they have a large selection (27 by my count) and they&#8217;re all in my queue now (which has reached triple digits in size). Does anyone else have the same desire to watch them all?
