When [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com) first came out, it was _moderately_ cool. You could search Outlook Mail, your files, Internet Explorer web history, and AOL IM chat history. I use Windows at work, so I tested it out. It worked from what I could tell, but I use Thunderbird for mail, Firefox for web, and Gaim for AIM chat. I totally forgot about Google Desktop.

Then Google Desktop [came out of beta](http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/03/taking-plunge.html). Not only did they add Firefox and Thunderbird support, they [supplied a plugin interface](http://desktop.google.com/developer.html). This is **huge**. That enables developers to add Google searching to any product. For example, someone could write a plugin to search Gaim logs. It&#8217;s tempting to get a free t-shirt, but as I don&#8217;t have a Windows box at home, I doubt I will even attempt making a plugin.

That&#8217;s just a small case. Imagine the possibilities! Search your iTunes library. Search Opera&#8217;s web history. If there was a Windows equivalent of Delicious Library, you could search that. They&#8217;ve even made it easier to access it by allowing you to embed it in your taskbar or make it a floating window. Very cool. Very **extensible**. These plugins take a mediocre product and make it _wicked cool_.
