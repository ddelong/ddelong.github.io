[Von-Age; the tele-fon works!](http://www.cards2phone.net/): Vonage has sent me dozens and dozens of advertizements and free phone deals for months lately. Seems like they&rsquo;re stalking me out after Verizon mentioned how I threatened to go into their Manhattan office three years ago in order to cancel my line faster (really it was a simple request they couldn&rsquo;t/wouldn&rsquo;t understand, cancel my line as of that day, they took 40 days to cancel my phone)

Anywho&rsquo;s, Saturday night about 3am I signed up to Vonage after my friend d00d (hi d00d!) sent me an invitation to try it out.

This is just more backup that the telcos have something to fear, and it ain't Skype.
