As I have only been to U-Mass once this school year, I haven&#8217;t had a good chance to get all the fabulous local delicacies. Yesterday, Sheila, my coworker, had wings.

That was enough to spark an intense craving for a big tray of honey barbeque wings from Wings in Amherst. I&#8217;m going out there Friday to get a huge tray of wings dripping in sauce that I can gorge myself on.

_Mmmmmmm._
