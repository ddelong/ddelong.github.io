My sadness quickly turned into rage last night because I wouldn&#8217;t have my toy this weekend. I read at several places, including Macworld&#8217;s forums that if you didn&#8217;t get your copy of Tiger on time, you could call Apple to get one of three things for free.

  * iLife &#8217;05
  * iWork
  * $30 Apple Store coupon

Finding this out, I called up and they promptly offered me iLife &#8217;05. I didn&#8217;t hear him offer the other two options, but personally, I didn&#8217;t care as that was what I wanted anyway.

So, for any of you disenchanted Apple fans that expected your copy on Friday and didn&#8217;t get it, call Apple up and see if you can collect on some free stuff.
