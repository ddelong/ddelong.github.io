Close friends already know that I just bought a townhouse in Tewksbury, Massachusetts (reducing my commute time to under half an hour). This is the big secret that I made reference to in earlier posts. I closed on Thursday.

Originally, I planned on posting that day or on Friday along with pictures. However, due to all the work associated with trying to move in, I haven&#8217;t had time (as evidenced by my _light_ posting). The pictures are taken, but now I need to download them from the camera and get them properly loaded onto Flickr. That&#8217;s another lengthy task I couldn&#8217;t get around to.

More observant readers may have been able to pick on the context clues, such as buying a cable modem and talking about getting Vonage. I&#8217;m sure I said other stuff that gave it away. It wasn&#8217;t really trying to keep it under wraps. I wanted to simply not crow about it, possibly putting a jinx on the deal (which I still believe was possible).

It&#8217;s been a very long hard road to get to home ownership. I didn&#8217;t really have a good guide to it. Because of this, I decided to add yet another direction for the site. I&#8217;m going to document my entire struggle, beginning to end. I&#8217;ll be changing names (except when I&#8217;m rewarding people for really helping me) because some of the stories are extremely embarrassing or at least I imagine it would be.

I&#8217;ll also be documenting major and minor repairs that I&#8217;ll be performing as a new homeowner. Let&#8217;s face it. When you watch This Old House and the carpenter is doing things that he&#8217;s done a million times before, it&#8217;s frustrating because he doesn&#8217;t touch on the finer points that a newbie wouldn&#8217;t know.

Hopefully I can help some people out. If not, the pictures should be fun to look at.
