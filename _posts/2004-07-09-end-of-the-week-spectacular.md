The weekend is a few scant hours away, as is yet another Red Sox game. I must be setting some kind of record here. I&#8217;ve gone for over two decades without going to a Red Sox game while living in Massachusetts, and now I&#8217;m going to at least three this year. The season isn&#8217;t even half over yet.

My Macally BTMouseJr is on its way finally. I&#8217;ve been waiting with baited breath for it, obsessively checking my order status over at [Page Computers](http://www.pagecomputers.com) \*ding\*. It has since gone to backorder status there, so it appears that this mouse is in high demand. Now I can shift my attention to [UPS](http://www.ups.com) and their web based package tracking system.

Speaking of tracking packages, that brings up my favorite Google trick ever. I don&#8217;t remember where I read about this gem, but I wish I could give them credit. At any rate, any time you get a tracking number for any package delivery company, plug it into Google. It will appropriately recognize that as a tracking number and produce a link to that package&#8217;s tracking page (in addition to any other pages it seems to be referenced in). Nifty. It&#8217;s far easier to get to the page that way, especially if you&#8217;re one of the enlightened few with some kind of Google bar in their browser.
