I live in Massachusetts. Snow is not a weather phenomenon here; it&#8217;s a way of life. Due to that fact, I&#8217;ve learned to accept snow and snowstorms. They can&#8217;t be avoided, only dealt with. Every time the white stuff hits the ground, I know I&#8217;m going to have to shovel it off the driveway and the deck. I know I&#8217;ll have to clean off my car. I know there&#8217;s going to be so much salt on the road that I&#8217;m going to go through a gallon of windshield wiper fluid (because, unlike peanuts, windshields are best when _unsalted_). I know traffic is going to be terrible going in to work.

It&#8217;s almost something I take pride in to deal with. It becomes a problem when it infringes upon my playtime. Right now, the status for my Radeon 9800 Pro is &#8220;Exception.&#8221; The estimated delivery date which formerly was today, is now missing. The last entry in the tracking system says &#8220;ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS CAUSED THIS DELAY.&#8221; However, it did arrive in Shrewsbury (the local UPS distribution station) last night, so maybe they&#8217;re just hedging their bets. At any rate, I&#8217;m going to be a whiny little boy today if I don&#8217;t get my toy. _pout_
