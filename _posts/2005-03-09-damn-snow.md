I live in Massachusetts. Snow is not a weather phenomenon here; it's a way of life. Due to that fact, I've learned to accept snow and snowstorms. They can't be avoided, only dealt with. Every time the white stuff hits the ground, I know I'm going to have to shovel it off the driveway and the deck. I know I'll have to clean off my car. I know there's going to be so much salt on the road that I'm going to go through a gallon of windshield wiper fluid (because, unlike peanuts, windshields are best when _unsalted_). I know traffic is going to be terrible going in to work.

It's almost something I take pride in to deal with. It becomes a problem when it infringes upon my playtime. Right now, the status for my Radeon 9800 Pro is &#8220;Exception.&#8221; The estimated delivery date which formerly was today, is now missing. The last entry in the tracking system says &#8220;ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS CAUSED THIS DELAY.&#8221; However, it did arrive in Shrewsbury (the local UPS distribution station) last night, so maybe they're just hedging their bets. At any rate, I'm going to be a whiny little boy today if I don't get my toy. _pout_
