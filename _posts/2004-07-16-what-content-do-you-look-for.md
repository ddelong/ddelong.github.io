Now that I have my own domain, it&#8217;s time I did something with it. While hosting the OS X Forum FAQ for Macworld and my blog are nice, I feel like I need more.

I could have a forum, but I&#8217;m not sure how much I really need one, especially since I wouldn&#8217;t host Mac topics.

I could have polls, but I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s real content on its own.

I could have a semi-news site with RSS feeds, but that&#8217;s been done to death.

Does anyone have any recommendations?
