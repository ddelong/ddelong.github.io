I think I may finally get satisfaction from my webhost.

> There are some problems currently being experienced by the apache servers at this time. Our admins are working on upgrading them to avoid these problems in the future. We apologize for the inconveniences caused by this and your site should be working shortly.

I&#8217;ll know that they&#8217;ll finished these upgrades when the upper right hand corner of my web page stops giving the fsockopen error message (which I had to implant). Hopefully the upgrade will also improve some speed issues as my page takes well over a second to be generated now (just a little sluggish).
