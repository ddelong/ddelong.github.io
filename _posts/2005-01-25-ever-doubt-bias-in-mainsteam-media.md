Now you can&#8217;t. I read this [out of CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/01/25/rice.confirmation/index.html?section=cnn_topstories):

> During the committee hearings, Boxer said the Bush administration had changed its rationale for the Iraq war from eradicating weapons of mass destruction after no such weapons were found.
> 
> In response, Rice asked Boxer to &#8220;refrain from impugning my integrity.&#8221;

That sounds pretty damning for Rice. It also seems very clear cut that she was avoiding a question. However, it doesn&#8217;t seem so when we examine the actual question posed (or at least what appears to be what Rice was responding to).

> When Senator Voinovich mentioned the issue of tsunami relief, you said &#8212; your first words were The tsunami was a wonderful opportunity for us. Now, the tsunami was one of the worst tragedies of our lifetime, one of the worst, and it&#8217;s going to have a 10-year impact on rebuilding that area. I was very disappointed in your statement. I think you blew the opportunity. You mentioned it as part of one sentence. And I would hope to work with you on this, because children are suffering; we&#8217;re worried they&#8217;re going to get in the sex trade. This thing is a disaster &#8212; a true natural disaster and a human disaster of great proportions.

Note, according to [the transcript](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/18/politics/18TEXT-RICE.html?ex=1106802000&en=fb4afff7b77ae83b&ei=5070&oref=login&pagewanted=print&position=), Rice [said no such thing](http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/8870). Also worthy of note is that Boxer didn&#8217;t so much as interview Rice as lecture her for untold minutes. According to Word, the speech leading up to Rice&#8217;s initial response was 2,109 words long. My application essay to U-Mass was capped at a fourth of that. Rice&#8217;s response wasn&#8217;t limited to that simple phrase either. It was 626 words long.

If CNN&#8217;s misleading, oversimplified version of Boxer and Rice&#8217;s extended exchange isn&#8217;t bias, I don&#8217;t know what is. Before you make any decisions about Rice&#8217;s answers, read the transcript. It paints quite a different picture than the one that Boxer has been trotting in front of the media.
