I'm both throroughly embarressed and relieved. The Mac Genius was able to fix my Powerbook.

The steps he took were:

  1. Re-sat the Airport card. _I didn't know that could be a common cause._
  2. Reset the power manager. _I did that._
  3. Reset the open firmware. _At this point, the screen was working. When I did it, I had to use my external display._

All is well again and seeing as a little bit of my pride saved me several hundred dollars, I think I can suck it up. I'll have to hold off a little on applying for a part-time Genius position though.
