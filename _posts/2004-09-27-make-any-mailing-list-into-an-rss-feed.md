I love keeping track of my favorite news sources in [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) by using RSS feeds. However, a lot of stuff I read is still distributed via email. This isn't too much of pain with a mail client that does threading or [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com).

That said, it's not nearly as convenient as using NetNewsWire (or your favorite RSS reader). The solution? It's a neat, new, novel, free idea called [dodgeit](http://www.dodgeit.com). There are no passwords or setup involved, but it's easy to sign up and you instantly have RSS access to email there. This is perfect for mailing lists whose content can be publicly accessed by anyone. It can even be used by mailing list administrators to instantly add RSS access. Nifty!

The service was originally designed to be used for throwaway addresses, but I think this use is even better.
