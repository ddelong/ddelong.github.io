The new NetNewsWire 2.0 (currently in beta) allows for definition of your own style sheets to define how news is displayed. I made my own (which was mean to be a fall styled theme, but ended up looking more like a Southwestern theme).

Install the expanded archive at ~/Library/StyleSheets/. Enjoy [my theme](ftp://anonymous%40godlikenerd%2Ecom:foo%40foo%2Ecom@ftp.godlikenerd.com/deriknnwstyle.gz).

Unfortunately, in order to connect and download from my FTP server, you need to attach &#8220;@godlikenerd.com&#8221; to &#8220;anonymous&#8221;. The password is your email address (or any email address). My webhost seems to have missed the entire point of anonymous FTP (every browser assumes just &#8220;anonymous&#8221; as the username). I'll deal.

**Addendum 1:** Apparently [Brent Simmons](http://ranchero.com/?comments=1&postid=929) found this post. Color me flattered. Someone requested that I post a screenshot and considering that I now have high visibility on this item, I'm definitely going to have to. I should also warn that I haven't cleaned this up for the combined view. I'm also going revise it for that today.

**Addendum 2:** I've updated my theme to 1.1. Below is a screenshot. I've moved the picture to the extended entry to keep homepage load time light.

**Addendum 3** _10/13/2004_: Changed the name to Autumn for [inclusion with NetNewsWire](http://godlikenerd.com/weblog/2004/10/13/my-theme-will-be-bundled-with-netnewswire/).
