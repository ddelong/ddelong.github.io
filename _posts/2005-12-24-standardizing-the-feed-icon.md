A big ado was made when the Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer team [announced they would use Firefox&#8217;s feed icon](http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/archive/2005/12/14/503778.aspx). I guess it&#8217;s better than yet another icon, but I never what the problem was with the original XML icon, etc. was in the first place. Mozilla seemed to create the icon because &#8220;RSS&#8221; wasn&#8217;t considered kosher considering the number of Atom feeds out there.

_As an aside, what&#8217;s even more maddening is that Safari **still** opts for Atom feeds over RSS feeds despite ordering in the source when one clicks the **RSS** subscribe button. Not only is that an inconvenience for webmasters, but it confuses the hell out of users._

I guess I can accept the new icon as the de facto standard. Firefox and IE are the two big players. I do have to find some irony here though. Firefox was pushed so heavily because it was a minority browser and helped push community established web standards into the published web. Now that it&#8217;s a major player with IE, the two of them have essentially ganged up to force their picked icon as the standard for xml based feeds. I missed the community involvement here. But I digress.

I can even try to overlook the fact that there is still a very real disconnect between rss and atom feeds and this icon. Typical non-geek users that don&#8217;t already know what the icon means aren&#8217;t going to know what it means. How is the average user supposed to identify this icon with this [rss feed](http://co-dependent.co.uk/how-to-understand-and-profit-best-from-rss) you speak of? They won&#8217;t.

You&#8217;re getting impatient. I can feel it. What&#8217;s the point? [This website](http://www.feedicons.com) is infuriating. Basically, some dude decided to try to use the current situation to derive some profit and attention to his own web designs. If we take a look at the [readme](http://www.feedicons.com/mint/pepper/orderedlist/downloads/download.php?file=http%3A//www.feedicons.com/download/readme.pdf) that&#8217;s on the site, we have four authoritative sources.

The last is of course itself. That&#8217;s authority by recursion. The third is a post by the author on his blog. The very same post that spawned the &#8220;project&#8221;. That leaves two sources, Microsoft&#8217;s announced adoption of the icon and a [blog post](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2005/12/firefox_feed_ic.html) by Asa Dotzler of Mozilla. Again, I&#8217;m missing the community involvement.

Now that we&#8217;ve all supposedly decided this is to be the standard, we come to this part of the site:

> ### Customize
> 
> Not a fan of orange? Download the package and customize the icon to your liking. We believe that as a symbol, the feed icon is recognizable enough that it doesn&#8217;t need to be restricted to one colour.

Who is we? What happened to a standard and trying get the userbase to recognize the one icon? Won&#8217;t users wonder if maybe the different color means different content? Maybe green means podcast? Meh.

In all fairness, I do believe that Matt is serving a very good purpose. He is supplying a high quality, scalable version of the icon. That&#8217;s certainly a great service to those that want to support the icon as the standard. Talking in the first person plural should be reserved for royalty. (I&#8217;ll try to reserve comments about the PayPal Donation button because bandwidth is expensive.)

However, there is one irony too delicious to ignore. The site uses a mailing list for notifications. If the irony doesn&#8217;t jump out right away, give it a moment. Okay, in case you missed it, a site promoting a new icon standard for XML based syndication feeds doesn&#8217;t itself offer an XML feed for notifications, opting instead to syndicate via email. I think that says it all. <!-- technorati tags start -->
