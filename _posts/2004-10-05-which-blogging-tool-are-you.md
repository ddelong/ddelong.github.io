This is admittedly geeky and probably only 1 out of 10,000 people will get any real enjoyment out of it, but I bet almost everyone will take this quiz anyway. Just because.

Thus, I pose the question, [which blogging tool are you?](http://www.wannabegirl.org/quiz/tool/)

<table width="200" style="font: 11px verdana; color: #666; border: 3px dashed #eef; margin: 0px; padding: 5px; text-align: center;">
  <tr>
    <td valign="middle">
      <a href="http://manila.userland.com/"><img src="http://wannabegirl.org/quiz/tool/manila.gif" width="88" height="31" border="0" alt="manila" /></a>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      You are a very conservative and introverted person. You live in your own world and you&#8217;re not very easy to approach.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://wannabegirl.org/quiz/tool/">Which Blogging Tool Are You?</a>
