I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve all read about [SmashMyiPod.com](http://www.smashmyipod.com). I thought it was infantile in concept before I read the website. You can imagine my shock when I read his _classy_ responses over on [Cult of Mac](http://cultofmac.com/index.php/2005/10/31/smashmyipod_responds_where_the_money_wen).

> I hear ipod video screens cause impotence and hair loss.

Then I made a stupid mistake and went to the site where I got to read the following.

> I hear iPods cause cancer and genetic mutations in fetuses.

I read two samples of his writing and he&#8217;s already sounding repetitive. His schtick isn&#8217;t even terribly clever or funny.

I hear reading his site and watching the video causes loss of brain cells and maturity.

**Update:** Then the guy [tries to crash and chew up the bandwidth of a rival site](http://cultofmac.com/index.php/2005/11/02/website_war_buymeanipod_hijacking_smashm) and gets pissed when the guy running the competing site steals the traffic to show his own site. Moron.
