I've added several key improvements to my blog. The first is the set-up of permalinks. Now instead of `http://godlikenerd.com/index.php?some=arguments&here=1&etc=2`, URL's for the articles follow this format `http://godlikenerd.com/weblog/year/month/day/article-name/` which is certainly much more readble. It should also be a very transparent change for users.

I've also added a local (to me) weather indicator to the right (which I thought was a nice addition). This was made possible through WordPress's plug-in system. Readers may have also noticed the acronym plug-in which makes common acronyms such as USB and CSS show their full text in a tooltip (hover your pointer over the dash-underlined word). I've also added a plugin which will automatically turn URL's into links.

I may add some more plug-ins, such as a polling mechanism.
