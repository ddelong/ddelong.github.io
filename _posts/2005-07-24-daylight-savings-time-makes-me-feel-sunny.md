Our lawmakers are hard at work. This time the pressing issue is [extension of daylight savings time](http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/07/22/congress.daylighttime.ap/index.html). The current plan is to extend it by a month total, three weeks in Spring and a week in the Fall. The goal of this legislation is to reduce oil consumption.

I&#8217;m no fan of daylight savings. It just means more work for me to change all my clocks. I&#8217;d be more in favor of dropping it entirely and picking one damn time scheme. After all, if extending it will save on oil consumption, shouldn&#8217;t moving to that time scheme permanently save us even more?

Reps. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, and Fred Upton, R-Michigan, must think there is substantial savings to be had. They originally wanted to extend by a whole month on both ends. They **must** have something to back up that claim. There must be some compelling reason to do this despite concerns about effects on livestock and international flight scheduling (as well as requiring [new programming for computers](http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/24/2018201&from=rss)).

Well, if you thought that like I did, you were wrong.

> Senate negotiators accepted the new version, along with a call for a study on how much daylight-saving time actually affects oil consumption.

Wait, wait, wait. They haven&#8217;t even done a study on how much the move would actually save? Isn&#8217;t that putting the cart before the horse, _just a little bit_? I would think that careful analysis of the pros and cons of a piece of legislation would be the first step before introducing it. I guess I was wrong.

Besides, who needs studies when you have reason like:

> &#8220;The beauty of daylight-saving time is that it just makes everyone feel sunnier,&#8221; said Markey.

and:

> Upton noted that the extension means daylight-saving time will continue through Halloween, adding to safety. &#8220;Kids across the nation will soon rejoice,&#8221; said Upton, because they&#8217;ll have another hour of daylight trick-or-treating.

Just thinking about it makes me feel &#8220;sunnier&#8221;. How about you?

**Update:** I didn&#8217;t even realize how [fucked up Indiana is](http://www.timetemperature.com/tzus/indiana_time_zone.shtml).
