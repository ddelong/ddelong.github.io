Tonight, the Red Sox are playing the L.A. Dodgers at Fenway (the first time the Dodgers have ever been there; thank inter-league play) and I&#8217;m going to be there for it. This will be only the second time in my life going to Fenway and that&#8217;s saying a lot considering I&#8217;ve lived in Massachusetts my entire life. My first game was only a couple weeks ago too (a game against the Mariners).

Is that overly sad? Well, thanks to Dana, a wonderful girl in Boston (within walking distance of Fenway) that&#8217;s far too nice to me, I&#8217;m seeing my second game. Derek Lowe will be pitching and hopefully he will turn things around and win this one (because we lost in the last one).

**Play Ball!**
