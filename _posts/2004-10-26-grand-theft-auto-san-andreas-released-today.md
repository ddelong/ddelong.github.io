[Rockstar Games](http://www.rockstargames.com) released [Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas](http://www.rockstargames.com/sanandreas/) today. I&#8217;ve been waiting for this game since I pre-ordered at [eCost](http://www.ecost.com) on July 25th earlier this year. They were offering the game for $38.95 at the time (with a $3.95 handling charge) which has since gone up to [$41.49](http://www.ecost.com/ecost/shop/detail.asp?dpno=400404) (shopping cart special).

Yes, I&#8217;ve been waiting a long time. If you count the time since I completed GTA: Vice City, it&#8217;s been even longer. Now I must wait for eCost to deliver it (which will feel like an eternity especially because they&#8217;re still estimating 10/28).

So go get yours! [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com) has it for [$49.99](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0001VGFK2/qid=1098799595/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-5261160-0755354?v=glance&s=videogames&n=507846). I tried to check Best Buy, but because they require cookies I can&#8217;t access it at work (and for that, they can go screw).
