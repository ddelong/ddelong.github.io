No Pats this week. Very sad.

  * St. Louis vs. **Seattle**
  * NY Jets vs. **San Diego**
  * Denver vs. **Indianapolis**
  * Minnesota vs. **Green Bay**

I picked Indy, but after the shameful way that they threw the last game of their season so they could play Denver, I hope Denver whoops them. Irony is delicious.
