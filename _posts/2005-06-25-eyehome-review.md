Earlier this week, my [El Gato EyeHome](http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyehome) arrived. It doesn&#8217;t come with any AV cables. So I had to march down to Wallyworld to pick up some cables. Then the fun began.

I had a few choices when it came to [cables](http://www.ramelectronics.net/html/howto-av.html). There&#8217;s composite, S-video, and component video outputs. For audio, there&#8217;s component and optical. Now, if I had the right equipment, the right connections would be the component video and the optical audio. _Optical audio: isn&#8217;t that an oxymoron?_ I don&#8217;t and I need the most flexibility, so I went with the component video and audio. Note that there is no RF coaxial output, so if that&#8217;s all your TV has, you may have to route it through a special adapter box or through your VCR.

After all the reviews I read, I expected the most pain-free install ever. It was close, but not quite there. However, I&#8217;m not sure I can fault the EyeHome. I&#8217;m connecting it through a wireless to ethernet adapter and switch. Upon turning on the EyeHome, it didn&#8217;t recognize that my Powermac upstairs had the software installed. Manually putting in its IP didn&#8217;t work either. Then I noticed that it had a self-assigned IP address (one starting with 169). Shutting down all the network equipment and starting it again fixed the issue and it&#8217;s worked ever since, so I don&#8217;t know what the issue really was, but it appears to have been transient.

Once I had that worked out, the Powermac appeared and I started playing. My EyeTV recordings showed up and played perfectly. However, the times listed didn&#8217;t seem right. The unit wasn&#8217;t setting its own time and date correctly and there is no way to set it manually (that can be counted as a flaw because I can imagine that sometimes the network the EyeHome is on won&#8217;t have an NTP server, but I digress).

I tried the rest of the features, save the movie one because I had no movies saved to my hard drive. They all performed as I would hope (except being unable to play iTunes Music Store files, but that&#8217;s not their fault). The movie playing function is much more important to me anyway. As a test, I used [Handbrake](http://handbrake.m0k.org/) to encode a movie. The first time I used an MPEG4 container with H.264 video and AAC video. It looked and sounded great. However, they didn&#8217;t sync up. I&#8217;m not sure what the problem was. I re-encoded into an AVI container with MPEG 4 video and MP3 sound. That synced up great. Perhaps the added complexity of AAC caused the sound delay. I&#8217;m not sure.

I did run into a problem with certain scenes though. In particular, White Noise has a lot of scenes that are almost all static. Those&#8230; scenes&#8230; would&#8230; skip&#8230; a&#8230; lot. Fortunately, those scenes were few and far between. All other video was fine as far as I could tell.

Despite some little issues, I feel like the $129 I spent on my EyeHome (refurbished price, brand new currently on sale for $150) was well worth it. At the $200 normal price, I&#8217;m a little more hesitant, but that&#8217;s just more reason to get one now.

**Pros:** Handles all kinds of media. Easy setup. Regular firmware updates. Works with EyeTV. Only $150.
  
**Cons:** Some initial setup problems. Doesn&#8217;t work with iTunes Music Store files. Issues with some intense movie sections. No manual time setting capability.
