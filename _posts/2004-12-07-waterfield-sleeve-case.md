I made a startling realization when I got my 12&#8243; Powerbook. It&#8217;s a lot smaller than the classic [Pismo](http://www.apple-history.com/frames/body.php?page=gallery&model=pg3sfirewire) that I&#8217;d been lugging around for 4 years. My [L.L. Bean](http://www.llbean.com) saddle bag&#8217;s laptop slot was actually too big for my shiny new Powerbook. The sides of the compartment are padded, so they naturally hold the shape. There&#8217;s so much room that the new &#8216;book flops around in it. It&#8217;s unsettling.

After a brief quest of asking for opinions on sleeves to insulate my Powerbook as well as some searching forums, a name that kept coming up was [Waterfield](http://www.sfbags.com). Much like Apple, the agreement was that the bags were pricey, but worth it. I liked the styling, so I bit the bullet and got one of their sleeves for my recent birthday.

I wasn&#8217;t let down.

<!--more--> The bag is solidly made with an incredibly soft lining. There&#8217;s no worrying about scratches with this bag.

As part of the ordering process, the fine folks at Waterfield also help you choose a size that ensures a snug fit.

I also ordered the flap cover and a strap so I could carry just the sleeve around if I wish. As an extra bonus, the bag also has pocket that covers the back of the bag. It&#8217;s not spacious, but it&#8217;s enough room to stuff your power adapter.

**Pros:** Solid construction, tight fit, great styling, friendly customer service.
  
**Cons:** At $70, very expensive.
