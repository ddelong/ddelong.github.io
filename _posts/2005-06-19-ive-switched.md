Not from Mac to Windows, or vice versa, but rather in a more important way. I&#8217;ve switched from the fabulous [LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/) to the very new and slick [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com). Between those two and [Butler](http://www.petermaurer.de/nasi.php?section=butler&layout=default), if they&#8217;re mentioned in the same breath to a large crowd, you can expect some blood to be spilled. You&#8217;d see a religious war that would rival the Mac OS X text editor war (BBEdit vs. SubEthaEdit vs. TextMate etc.).

I was a huge LaunchBar fan. Soon after I registered it, I started hearing things about Quicksilver. Being free and open-source, I thought I&#8217;d give it a try. I was less than impressed. I didn&#8217;t see any compelling features and the results I got weren&#8217;t nearly as good as LaunchBar&#8217;s. I deleted it and ran back to LaunchBar.

Recently, I started reading [43 Folders](http://www.43folders.com), which has frequent articles on it. Either I missed a lot, or Quicksilver gained a lot of functionality since I last tried it. I&#8217;m going to lean to the latter. At any rate, until LaunchBar gains the ability to perform the breadth of actions that Quicksilver can (which is extensible), I&#8217;m switching.
