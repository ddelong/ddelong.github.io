Last night I went into Boston to see the fireworks on the Charles River. I'd never gone before, so the best fireworks I'd seen up until that point were sparklers (and on the TV). Originally, I was thinking about going to see the Pops, sit in the esplanade, and watch the fireworks overhead. When I found out that I'd have to be there at 10 AM at the latest, I decided it wasn't worth that much to me, at least for now.

Some people had shown up as early as 10 PM the night before, prompting the question: &#8220;Do you have a life?&#8221; I'm not trying to trivialize the Pops and the show that they put on. The band itself is spectacular and I'm the show is great, but not sit outside all night great. Let's be honest with ourselves here. It's just a nice concert and honestly, I'm willing to shell out some money to see them in concert rather than sleep on the sidewalk like a homeless person.

Instead, Dana and I opted to head down Mass Ave at around 9:15 (which was even a bit early). The bridge was covered with people and subsequently, the road was blocked off. We found a good spot and waited the half hour until 10 when we thought the fireworks were supposed to start. Well, right around 10, some fireworks did get set off, about thirty seconds of them. We then had to wait another half hour until the real fireworks started. By far, they were the best fireworks I'd ever seen. Definitely worth the wait. It was only today upon returning home that I found out why we had to wait a half hour. The Pops concert ran longer than expected.

Of course, this can be expected when they do two encore songs (as they did when I went to see them for Celtic night). It's a little cynical, but why don't they just put the songs on the program they are going to play? They don't play them spur of the moment. Those songs get just as much attention as the rest of the program and from the way the audience reacted, it wasn't out of the ordinary to play a couple encore songs, defeating the purpose of them.

There were two things (or people rather) that detracted from my fireworks experience, the first being a guy with a camcorder who kept creeping into my field of vision. Normally, I would have let this slide, but his constant interference was irritating. I don't know if he heard me, but at one point I said, &#8220;I think someone should tell that guy that they record this for the TV.&#8221; I mean really. There were dozens of people video-taping it. I can only surmise this was an excuse to use their video cameras, but the best thing to do would have been to just set up your VCR and record it. Not only do you get a professional grade recording (using real equipment) but you get the music to go along with it. Are they going to show it later and point out the heads of all the people that were in front of them that got in the way of the shot?

The other moron that irritated me was and is the original Captain Obvious. &#8220;I think they're going to play the 1812 Overture.&#8221; &#8220;David Lee Roth is performing with the Pops.&#8221; Not only were those gems part of his obnoxiously loud dialogue, but so were &#8220;higher&#8221; and &#8220;louder&#8221; when they were shooting off the fireworks. Thanks buddy, I don't think they thought of that. He would also raise his hands every time something shot up and describe the motion of the sparkles by waving his fingers and letting his hands drift sideways. Is there no shame left?

Immediately following the fireworks, everyone started heading down Mass Ave in what can only be described as a tidal wave of people. Cars of all kinds (including Ambulances) were engulfed by people with no way to move. Constant swearing and honking became the standard greeting for pedestrians. This was of course returned by the international one-fingered greeting.

In short, it was something not to be missed.
