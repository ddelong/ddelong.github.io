It&#8217;s no surprise that [Digg](http://digg.com) became a target for spam, but would you believe that [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) is now a target? Check [this guy](http://del.icio.us/webiest) out.

Don&#8217;t click his link. It leads to a dummy Blogspot page containing nothing but an ad for Google&#8217;s Firefox toolbar extension. Blogspot is fast becoming a playground for spammers. Google needs to get a tighter grip on that.

At any rate, the guy labeled that single link with every technology buzzword out there in order to pollute del.icio.us. It&#8217;s amazing the stupid lengths these jackasses will go to.
