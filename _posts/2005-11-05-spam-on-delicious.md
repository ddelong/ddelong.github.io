It's no surprise that [Digg](http://digg.com) became a target for spam, but would you believe that [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) is now a target? Check [this guy](http://del.icio.us/webiest) out.

Don't click his link. It leads to a dummy Blogspot page containing nothing but an ad for Google's Firefox toolbar extension. Blogspot is fast becoming a playground for spammers. Google needs to get a tighter grip on that.

At any rate, the guy labeled that single link with every technology buzzword out there in order to pollute del.icio.us. It's amazing the stupid lengths these jackasses will go to.
