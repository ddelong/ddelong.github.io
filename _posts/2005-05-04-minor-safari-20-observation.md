I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m the only one using a Mac that has become really accustomed to using context menus. Until I started using gestures to operate my web browser, I would regularly use the context menu to move back (because clicking the back button is really inconvenient).

Safari continually jerked me around by being _the only browser_ that didn&#8217;t have back and forward options. It&#8217;s one of the most common functions. This finally changed in Tiger and Safari 2.0.

Thank you Apple.
