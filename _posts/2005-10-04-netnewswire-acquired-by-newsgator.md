To be fair, I didn't use [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) until this morning when I heard rumors of this move on the NetNewsWire mailing list. I've always been a [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) fan myself. However, the NNW/Bloglines synchonization left a lot to be desired, mostly due to deficiencies in Bloglines's API.

Now that NewsGator has [acquired NetNewsWire](http://newsgator.com/NetNewsWire.aspx), it looks like I may finally get the cross-computer, cross-platform syncing I've been craving (much like what IMAP does for my email). It also looks like I'll get access to FeedDemon, which was [also acquired](http://newsgator.com/FeedDemon.aspx).

For those cases when I'm not at one of my Macs or my work PC, I'll be able to get my news through a web interface which upon cursory examination looks very similar to Bloglines. All in all, it looks like a terrific move and I'm looking forward to the next version of NNW.
