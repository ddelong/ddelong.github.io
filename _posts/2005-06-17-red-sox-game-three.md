I&#8217;m sure this will piss off a few people (and already has some others), but I saw my third Red Sox game of the season this past Tuesday night. And this is after the World Series I said that it would be impossible for me to see even a single game. But I digress.

Anyway, Allison invited me to go with her as part of a package deal that her mother had access to. The package was a bus ride into Boston, as much beer as you could drink, a sandwich, and a ticket to the game. Not that bad.

What was bad was the ride in. I started pounding beers, as did Allison. We arrived at the first and only rest stop on the way (from Worcester). I didn&#8217;t really feel like peeing and being all man, I didn&#8217;t to _break the seal_. Allison didn&#8217;t want to either, but I doubt it had anything to with wanting to be all man.

That decision caught up with me really quickly. We&#8217;d barely reached the 128 exit and I was dying to write my name in some snow. Well, the rest of the ride became a blur as that desire turned into a necessity. All I could think about was peeing and how immature not wanting to break the seal was.

Anyway, as we rolled (slowly) through Boston, I decided I just couldn&#8217;t wait any longer. My kidneys started to hurt. I shit you not. Thankfully Allison couldn&#8217;t wait either, so we jumped out of the bus in the middle of Boston. We rushed into the Cheesecake Factory. I swear to you, answering nature&#8217;s call never felt so good.

We walked out, saw that the bus was gone. We had to find Fenway. Thanks to having visited Dana so many times, I did. We were really close to her old apartment so I took charge (that&#8217;s 100% testosterone) to get us there an out into the second inning.

It was a good game, a 7-0 victory against the Reds (not that much of a triumph really). In fact, deep into the sixth inning it looked like Wells was going to pull out a no-hitter. Honestly though, the events preceding the game are far more exciting.

The ride home sucked. I don&#8217;t even want to relive it to write the story. $60 for all that was pretty worth it.
