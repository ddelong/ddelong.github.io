I haven't been posting too much lately because I've been spending nearly all my time for the past two weeks serving as a juror in Worcester. It's over (finally).

I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, but let me make this clear, after two weeks of it, I can safely say I'm ready for the guaranteed three years off. I'd be a little more verbose about the experience, but I feel like it's not entirely appropriate to post all the details onto the web.

I will be more than happy to discuss the details privately though. Email or IM me if this strikes your fancy.
